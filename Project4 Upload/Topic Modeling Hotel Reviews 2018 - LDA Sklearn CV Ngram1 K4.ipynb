      "Negative reviews 27: the location of this place is prime the hotel condition on average is nice i found my room fantastic with a kitchenette and living room the elevators were old and confusing only one went to the garage but you could not call just that one and there were no stairsbreakfast was average the scrambled eggs were really dry and so were the wafflesfrench toastsome of the staff were kind and helpful but many didnt seem to care and others seemed new maybe this location had a high influx of new front desk members at the time of my stay there are two kiosks at the front desk and a phone between while i was checking in the other kiosk was also occupied by a staff member assisting a customer and another staff member was using the phone between to talk loudly to a service member about a customer who had not had their room cleaned in three days this was concerning distracting and offputting this also distracted the lady helping me check in from doing her jobone night we were awoken by a very loud banging noise coming from the room next to us close to midnight the banging accompanied by yelling continued for several minutes worried and scared i called the front desk but the person who answered didnt seem to care about the situation and at first didnt offer a solution until i asked if there was nothing they could do and they said they would send somebody up there again the front desk staff member said the lady had been locked out by her partner who had deadbolted the door by this point the lady had been standing outside her room yelling and banging on the door for half an hour by her account overheard when she yelled at her partner when he finally opened the door im worried that the staff allowed this to continue for so long what if the partner had been suffering a medical emergency or had never opened the door nobody followed up with us regarding this issue which was disappointing had someone touched base in the morning and apologized for the inconvenience i likely wouldnt be writing this reviewupon checkout the front desk staff threw away a handwritten not eaddressed to me as a guest of the company whose conference i was attending because my partner was performing the checkout overall i was really let down by my stay here the rooms are so nice and the location is great i thought the hyatt brand could be trusted with providing a great seamless customer experience but it didnt seem like they caredhello and thank you for taking the time to share your experiences at our hotel with us first i offer my sincere apologies for the poor care shown to you by my team we are in the process of training several new additions to our staff but this does not excuse the lack of professionalism and lack of interest in resolving your concerns promptly and with care please know that i have addressed your concerns with my team so that we can continue to improve our quality of care if i can be of any additional assistance please contact me directly\n",
