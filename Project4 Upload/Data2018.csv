4.0,"Hotel is in the perfect spot at the perfect price with the not so perfect view. Expedia rep said that it was facing the water and in a way it was but at a 45 degree angel past the parking lot and a few other obstructions. You have to stretch your neck at the furthest corner of the window to gain a peak. But it was still good though. The room sleeps like nobody's business. Once your head hits the pillows its light out. What I did not like was the front desk personnel. They really did not like there job and it showed. No eye contact, no smiles, no small talk, and what really disturbed me was at check in when I was told to sign this that's how it was put. I was like what is it Just sign - its nothing. Sir What am I signing. Oh if you have a party and smoke we can charge you 250.00(eyes still on monitor). Well sir. Tell me that. Next. Came back later that night to get snacks out of the cupboard. Over priced but I expected that but the person at the front desk was lifeless and didn't not even give me a total. She just says. Its charged to your room and kept staring at her monitor(again the monitor). WOW. But what makes up for some of the small inconsistencies is that fact that the water is in walking distance. The Ferris wheel is right there and Gaylord Hotel is right across the street. Good energy in the area and great spots to eat(Redstone) . Cant wait to visit again. Thanks for the snacks!",2018
4.6,"Bad: Timing seemed to be off. Had to wait a very long time for breakfast, longer than people who had come in after us. Had to wait a very long time for the valet to bring our car, seemed to be some kind of communication issue. They were nice about it, and so were we, but it seemed to be a theme, which was a bit of a disappointment. Good: Nicely appointed room, great location.",2018
4.8,"Good: I loved the quirkiness and style of the hotel. The staff were so friendly and accommodating. The drinks at the bar were top notch and the price for the location was unbeatable. And the bed, the bed was perfect. I slept like a baby.",2018
5.0,Bad: This is really not a reflection on the hotel but the valet parking does take a long time to retrieve your car. They tell you to allow 30 minutes and you really need to do that. Good: Friendly staff. Clean rooms.,2018
5.0,"Good: Perfection - beautiful rooms, comfortable beds, great style. Centrally located for all the fun things in downtown Boston.",2018
4.6,"Bad: I think the hotel could do more to promote the on site restaurant with newly arrived guests. My husband tried it and thought the food was great but if there'd been a deal or something to catch our attention I'm sure we'd have eaten breakfast there both mornings of our stay. I also think that although the space inside the rooms seems to be well used that there are some practical challenges with storage where existing space could be better used for the ease and comfort of guests. Good: Very comfortable beds. Not massive but cosy and we all slept well. The linens were clean and fresh and we enjoyed the L'Occitane products in the bathroom. The staff were friendly, kind and helpful.",2018
4.15,"Bad: The minibar and the heating were noisy, but it didn't really disrupt our sleep. Breakfast was good, but perhaps the avocado toast was a bit small for the price. Good: The staff were all friendly and professional. Our room was clean and warm (it was cold out!) and had everything we needed. The drinks and food were very good, especially the Finch burger and the crab bennies at breakfast. Overall, we really liked the feel of the hotel and would definitely stay again, especially if we were going out of North Station again which is just around the corner.",2018
2.9,Bad: Just want to say paying 330 for one night would have been nice too get breakfast included in the price. . Good: At least it wasnt too far from TD garden.,2018
4.4,Good: Perfect location if you're attending an even at the Garden. Very short walk,2018
2.5,"Bad: The place was falling apart, the tub was cracked and broken. the bathroom shelf was barely holding on. The bed was extremely tough to sleep on. Good: I liked that it was close to entertainment. The shower held a hot water temperature for a long time.",2018
5.0,Bad: I lost roulette. Good: Buffet bb,2018
2.9,Bad: No business center..wifi wasnt free..it asked for ten bucks...the internet kiosk was 650 for 30 mins..but deducted 20 mins to print boarding passes and no shuttle to airport. Good: Location,2018
3.35,"Bad: I was in room 314, and its very noisy at night with the street ambiance, so dont expect to sleep before 2AM. I had to take my breakfast to adjacent hotels as continental / seated proper breakfast was not available (or couldnt find it...). Good: The bed was confortable and the location is just amazing on Fremont street.",2018
4.6,Bad: There's nothing not to like here. Though the maid service was good but they are kind of early to knock at the door for cleaning service. They're there at 8am and we were still in dreamland that we were forced to get up and open the door to talk to them to clean later. Good: We love our very spacious room though we didn't have a single king sized bed. They gave us twin beds but it's fine. The Garden court buffet was also great! It was very affordable. We almost eat there everyday because of its price. Please keep it that way.,2018
3.95,"Bad: The bed was stiff and valet parking only. Wifi is pay only and didn't live up to the speed expectations as advertised. Good: The location is great, easy access to all of Fremont area with a short walk. Not being a giant casino you don't have to walk far from the car or through the place to get out.",2018
4.6,"Good: The hotel is really beautiful! A little old, but clean and comfortable. The price is also good.",2018
4.8,Bad: Shower Tub clogged. Good: Convenient location. Reasonable food prices. Awesome selection of cuisine. Helpful staff!,2018
3.15,Bad: The shower didnt drain. The pillows were horrible. My feet stuck to the carpet in the room. Good: Location,2018
3.55,Bad: The ventilation system was not adequate for the building. Everything including room smelled like cigarette smoke. Good: restaurant,2018
4.8,"Good: The location was easily accessible to any downtown activities and the strip, we went to the pinball neon museum and the fremont street experience in one day. It was great",2018
2.5,"Bad: Old outdated rooms, even though its a classic hotel does not mean they dont have to put forth effort to modernize rooms. Good: Was right in Fremont street",2018
4.4,"Bad: Street noise. Good: Decor, table games, dining",2018
5.0,Bad: Breakfast was missing protein. Only bagels and donuts. Good: Location! Location! Location!,2018
5.0,Good: Location is fabulous. Got there very early and was able to check in! Room was clean and modern. Love this hotel!,2018
2.7,Bad: Size of room. Good: Leaving,2018
4.15,Bad: The breakfast is nothing special. Parking is 30 per each 24Hrs.,2018
2.9,"Bad: The rooms are tiny, but expensive. The staff was not very friendly or helpful. They seemed bored and not so welcoming to visitors. They didnt refill the coffee thermos for breakfast and didnt care to either. It was awkward. Good: The place is clean and centrally located. I enjoyed the music playing in the room upon arrival. Its been updated although its an old building.",2018
3.75,Bad: The room was right off the elevator so you could hear everyone coming off of it. Good: The bathroom was very nice. The shower has great water pressure and the shower head is adjustable.,2018
4.15,"Bad: Breakfast was inadequate, no protein. Small bathroom. No luggage cart. Good: Location and discount parking. Clean with nice staff. Near subway station and Newbury St. with lots of good restaurants within walking distance.",2018
5.0,"Bad: The TV was on in the lounge during breakfast, tuned to GMA and Kelly Ripa-terrible shows, too loud, couldn't find a remote. It would be better on close caption with no sound or another channel, or have the remote so that breakfasters can change it. Thanks!. Good: Atmosphere. Location.",2018
5.0,Everything was perfect,2018
4.4,Cozy room and vibe to this place... many food options close by.. minutes from Fenway Park and the house of blues,2018
4.4,Good: Coffee and juice were nice to start out the day with! Cold cereal would have been a plus.,2018
5.0,Nothing to complain about Everything was fine and week with the price. It is very central in Boston and close to the public transportation.,2018
4.15,"Bad: No hot water in the morning. Poor choice for breakfast - very little that was healthy. Good: Great location, nice room.",2018
4.6,"Bad: I think there could be more options offered as breakfast (there were only bagels and donut like something, and fruits), but it was still enough. So it's not something I didn't like but something that can be improved. Good: This hotel was a great one! When we entered room, there was classical music coming from the stereos, which give us a very nice feeling to start with. The bathroom, the towels, the bed, everything was clean, organized. I wish I could stick around more and enjoy the room as I stayed for 2 nights and was in the hotel to sleep only. The room was also facing the Boston public library, which was a blissful view, that makes you feel like you're in full luxury. The surrounding area was great, the parallel street (I believe it was Newburry) is full of nice clothing boutiques. It's really close to variety of food options and also right next to Copley station which makes public transportation a total ease. But I think when the weather permits, it's totally walkable to go around Freedom Trail etc. Also, I arrived very early in the morning and left in the middle of night, both felt okay to be out in the street, which is something I value the most.",2018
5.0,Bad: Dont change a thing. Good: Staff was very accommodating even those we shared elevator rides with. Location was central and easy to walk places. We enjoyed our stay.,2018
5.0,"Bad: Couldn't find fault with anything. Good: It might sound strange to say that I was ill in bed for most of my stay but still gave the hotel top ratings!. However, the room was extremely comfortable and clean. The staff were very helpful and pleasant and the location was great. We were in the annex which fronts onto Ocean Drive and there was a very good cafe/bar below. I found out towards the end of the stay they also did room service. Wish I had been well enough to take advantage of this great little hotel.",2018
5.0,"Bad: Expensive of course, wish the hotel restaurant was more reasonably priced because we wanted to go but couldnt justify. Good: Bed was great and the staff was so genuinely kind",2018
3.55,"Bad: Very noisy at night (24h party directly below the rooms in the other building, traffic). We didn't stay in the main building, we weren't informed before. So please check before, otherwise there's not much sleep possible. Good: Next to Ocean Drive, so the beach is over the street. Room was huge and clean. Valet parking was very fast (39/d), staff was friendly. Also the roomservice was fast and delicious.",2018
4.6,Bad: Can be a little noisy at night but that is the compromise for being at the centre of all the action. Good: If you are looking to be at the centre of all the South Beach madness then this is the perfect hotel. Located right across from the beautiful beach and in the middle of the Art Deco district. Large comfortable rooms that offer full amenities. Good rooftop pool with great snack and drinks bar. Staff very helpful and John the concierge was great.,2018
5.0,"This hotel is in the perfect location! A half block from Broadway Times Square in the Theater District. The lobby is nothing special, as is the streetfront of the hotel. Our room was clean and very nice. We had a King Deluxe. The bed was ok, not bad, but not exceptional. The toiletries in the bathroom were great! I usually don't use them, but I loved them all. The continental breakfast offered a nice array of options, and was well stocked. The coffee was very good. The free wi-fi was a nice bonus.We had a bit of a problem checking in. We arrived at about 11:30am. I had been told the day before, that it was possible that our room could be ready by 10:30 am, although check in was officially at 4pm. Our room was not ready, so we left our bags, with a promise that we'd be texted as soon as our room was ready. We checked back at about 3pm, even tho we had not been texted. Still not ready, they'd text. We came back about seven, still no text, and were finally able to check in. As we checked in, I heard someone asking about a wine and cheese hour. We had missed it! I remarked to my husband, that I would have loved a glass of wine after such a hectic day. The male who checked us in heard me, and asked what kind of wine we liked, and said that he would send some up, on the house! Within minutes, two bottles of wine, on ice and 2 glasses arrived. To be able to relax in our room, with a glass of wine, really made up for our late check in! The whole staff was very nice and I would definitely stay there again.",2018
4.0,"Had a really nice stay at hotel renew. Was close to the beach near to where they have a concrete break to stop the waves crashing, so would be good for young families. The bed was really comfy. Only a couple of negatives, the room we were in had a window in the bathroom, and a frosted glass door to the bathroom. This meant light streamed in through the window and door in the morning. Also there wasn't much for breakfast if you are trying to avoid sugar and there wasn't a lot of space.Aloha!!!Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much) for choosing to stay with us and for providing valuable feedback of your experience.

5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by my visit. After arriving in NYC, I noticed that I booked the wrong Four Seasons. It was my intention to stay at the Four Seasons close to Central Park. However, the services at the Four Season Downtown location exceeded my expectations. They were able to provide check-in for an early arrival (11:00 am) to a spacious, clean beautiful room. The breakfast provided through room-service was delicious (you must try the truffle scramble eggs). My dinner at the Cut was outstanding. This is an exceptional addition to the Financial Area.",2018
5.0,"I am currently in house and felt in necessary to write a review immediately. This hotel is amazing and I would recommend it to any and everyone staying in NOLA. The entire staff is fantastic and friendly. Even prior to arrival, their service was seamless. I had to send a credit card authorization because my wallet was stolen and it was handled by the staff in no time at all. I even mentioned that I was arriving super early in the morning and I arrived at 9am to find my room was already checked in and waiting for me, which was so beyond my request. It is hip, trendy, fun, lively and worth every dollar. The room, while on a low floor, is perfect. I had a problem with my television, which I normally need to sleep and even though it was late and the staff could not immediately rectify the issue, it was the way it was handled that truly made all the difference. I could not be more pleased. I will say one thing.. a word to the wise, if you will. Bourbon Street will get you every time. I was somehow hungover by 6pm. Drink Responsibly.",2018
5.0,"It was our first visit to NOLA and first stay at Bienville House but it will not be our last! From check in to check out we were treated courteously, even at the restaurant/bar where we had fun drinking fun drinks. Our room was beautiful...so NOLA and the marble bathroom and shower was perfect...LOVE Bienville House!!!",2018
4.8,"Bad: nothing. Good: Location is perfect. Near to the beach, resturants, lounge bar, etc. the room is good and clean.",2018
3.15,"Bad: I didnt like being charged daily fees for the beach/pool when I never used them. Good: I was incorrectly being charged for the previous guests breakfast, its a good thing I checked my bill. I liked that the complaint was immediately checked and the bill promptly rectified.",2018
5.0,Good: Location is just excellent! And the fact that they provide you included sunbed at the beach!,2018
3.75,Bad: Bathroom a bit small. Good: Good hotel. Close to beach and bars and restaurants. Good staff,2018
4.4,Bad: Expensive but all of south beach is. . Good: Location,2018
5.0,"Good: Excellent location, clean interior, very good staff. Easy check in/out. Free parking where the nearby hotels charge for parking even if you stay there.",2018
4.8,"Bad: I can't think of anything. Good: The hotel was less than 1/2 mile to the strip (an easy 10 minute walk), which allowed me to be close enough to take advantage of it, but far enough removed to get away from the mega-ness of it. Check-in was easy, the staff was friendly and helpful, the size of the room was pretty standard (which is all I wanted or needed), the bathroom was clean and well-appointed, and the bed was comfortable.",2018
4.8,Bad: Was a little too far to walk to the strip. Good: Bartender was awesome got complimentary drinks at bar. Very clean.,2018
2.9,Bad: Facilities feel outdated. Good: Breakfast was great and the Starbucks in the lobby was awesome!,2018
4.15,"Bad: Hotel is old, need refurbishment. Good: Value for money",2018
3.55,Bad: Construction noise woke us at 6:15 am But I was credited 1 day of the resort fee for the rude noise. Good: Bed was comfy Free bourbon tasting and dessert in their bar was a plus,2018
4.8,"Good: Delightfully smoke free! No casino, so much quieter than regular Las Vegas hotels. Just behind The Flamingo, so short walk to monorail, Paris or the strip. The concierge, Spencer, was very helpful in getting back to the motel quickly after our show.",2018
4.15,Bad: Nc. Good: GReat beds!,2018
2.5,"Bad: Room service was slow, have hidden pet fees and rules, and the pipes werent working. Good: They have a doggie potty area and spacious rooms",2018
5.0,Bad: I had to be switched because these people next door were partying all hours of the night. At 3am they decided to start arguing in the hall. I called security once for them to turn up their music right after they left. Then security came up again while they were in the hall screaming. I will say this the hotel made it right. They gave me that night free and switched me rooms. Good: The rooms were beautiful. Comfy beds good breakfast.,2018
3.55,Bad: I expected to have a much larger room that looks more like a suite.,2018
5.0,"The Broome doesnt feel like NYC at allIt captures the elegance of Morocco and you feel a world away from the traffic and bustle of the city. The rooms are small, which is standard in NYC, but I did expect a bit more space for the price. The beds are comfy with super luxury sheets. This might be an odd point, but many of the luxury hotels I have been in lately have moved away from using a fitted sheet on the bed, which leaves the guest with a flat sheet on the bottom that twists and bunches by the morning. I was delighted that The Broome still uses both flat and fitted sheetsit is a must for a good nights sleep! The staff is enthusiastic and welcoming. A good stay, indeed!Dear ECWPhD:On behalf of the team, thank you again for staying with us and thank you for sharing your feedback with us. It was a delight welcoming you into our little Oasis. In fact our rooms are designed in and out to offer a little break from the city while you are in the city. We wish to have you back again very soon.

4.8,Good: The breakfast was amazing and the comfort of the room was perfect.,2018
4.8,Good: Very good service. Excellent dinner in hotel restaurant,2018
4.15,"Bad: I thought the bathroom was a bit small for the space and the physical appearance could have been a bit more modern and sharp. Good: I liked the spacious nature of the room. The bed was super comfortable. The staff were super attentive, helpful and friendly",2018
4.8,Bad: There was a lot of noise out on the street around 3am. Not the fault of the Hotel. Good: The staff and atmosphere were amazing. The beds were super cozy! Security staff at the hotel were awesome,2018
3.15,"Bad: Expensive! I know that it was but the room i expected to be way better as a mega room seemed so regular , the price wasn't worth it . Good: Nice scenery",2018
2.7,Bad: Within the first 15 minutes of being there we got a complaint from a neighbor for having music too loud. The speaker was not even up half way and it was 4 oclock in the afternoon on a Saturday. At the end of the night staff were rude.,2018
4.8,Bad: Bathroom doors. Good: Lovely room. Good size.,2018
5.0,"My wife will thank me forever. Wonderful hotel in Miami, not on the main beach strip but I would say in a better position, if what you want to do is relax and enjoy the area. The rooms were superb and we had one with a huge balcony overlooking the harbour and pool. Breakfast was just and simply amazing especially when sitting outside in the morning. Pool area well maintained and serviced by staff. There are very few amenities outside of the hotel, one has to walk for about 10 minutes to get to shops etc. Concierge services was very helpful, a big shout out to Carlos who was the most helpful concierge guy we had come across for a while, he is a mine of information about the local area. This hotel oozes luxury and very family friendly, my family of 4 was really looked after, Two small gripes, the hotel should have somewhere in the evening where a family can enjoy drinks and desserts, that is not the bar, very often we could not get a space there in the evening or felt uncomfortable to be there with kids, the other point being in room dining could be improved, the menu was a bit short for us and the kitchen was not flexible enough to tailor some dishes, for example making the pasta spicy, we ordered some rice with our chicken and it was just undercooked , it was changed immediately and we were given complimentary glasses of wine but it was too late when one is starving !",2018
5.0,"We stayed at the Ritz for 5 nights in a club levelSuite. Location was wonderful, right by Boston Common and multiple T stops. Service was wonderful, especially from the concierge, front desk and club lounge staff. Staff made my 4 young children feel special and they enjoyed the scavenger hunt and little toys provided. The room was lovely and well appointed though a little smaller than it appeared in the website. I would definitely stay here again when I Boston! In fact Im planning on a business trip to Cambridge soon and considering staying here and commuting.Dear mnmorange,So glad to hear you enjoyed your recent stay with your family at The Ritz-Carlton, Boston, with all of the city so easily accessible just outside our doors. It is wonderful to know that you and your children were well taken care of by the friendly and professional ladies and gentlemen throughout the hotel. Thank you for taking the time to comment on your visit. We hope you will return for that upcoming business trip - getting to Cambridge from the hotel is a breeze - as well as many more occasions, when it will be our sincere pleasure to welcome you back.Warmest regards,William P. Bunce, General Manager",2018
4.0,"We spent 5 nights here in a regular room in December. The good: We loved the building's character, and old NYC charm. The location can't be beat. The butlers were overall very helpful, especially Emina. The car service is lovely, and the driver we had (Robert) was very nice. The concierges were interacted with (I have forgotten names) were both superb. Housekeeping was OUTSTANDING after the first night. Very much appreciated. The bell staff and doormen were also mostly really great. We felt very welcomed most of the time we interacted with staff.The not as good: A few minor misses upon entering room for the first time - there was some debris from prior guests. One of the butlers didn't provide the same great service as the others. Nothing to be totally fussed about, but these misses stand out all the more against the otherwise stellar service. Really the only true disappointment was that we weren't impressed by our Room Service breakfast at all - best to skip.Overall, we really enjoyed our time here and do recommend if it fits your NYC plans.Dear Nakoa G,Thank you very much for reviewing your recent stay at The St. Regis New York. We greatly appreciate you taking the time to write you review and provide us with your feedback.

5.0,"My wife and I stayed at the St Regis for 8 nights in June 2018 as part pleasure part business trip. This was our second time at the hotel and we cannot fault it. The staff were exceptional and made our stay very memorable. The hotel's location made it great to get around the City and the friendliness of the staff made our time there very enjoyable.

3.0,"I have stayed for New Year's Holiday.I was looking forward to visiting this hotel very very much. and I requested to them that I would like a high floor at their web site while reservation. as a result,my timeline on arrival day is following.11:30 arrival at Hotel,and deposit luggage. the representative of reception saidWe accept your request. at this time.15:45 Challenge for the first check-in.

5.0,"Welcome to one of the most iconic and beautiful hotels of Manhattan! Marble, crystals, golden leaf paintings, elegantly decorated rooms combining newest technology and extreme comfort in a charming style that one may find somehow a little bit Marie Antoinette. Kind staff, great Doorman from Bretagne, Champagne sabotage at the Bar. Maybe some room for improvement on the side of the kitchen to refine the bar menu and breakfast. A wonderful home feel.

5.0,Good: Best hotel robe Ive ever had. Beautiful room. Very nice staff.,2018
5.0,Good: Wonderful hotel with great location and customer service. The lounge was amazing every night for a drink and snacks. Couldnt have asked for a better experience. Breakfast every morning was way better then we expected. Contacting the front desk was easy via text for anything we needed or with questions. We have traveled to many other cities and Europe and this was one of our top stays.,2018
4.8,Bad: I couldn't understand why the fan constantly as if it never reached the desired temperature.Also that nightly service fee of 14.95 is a rip-off.,2018
5.0,Bad: I had someone partying and playing super loud music above me or next to me all night. Got no sleep.,2018
5.0,Bad: Our room view was pretty poor as it was looking out and into adjacent old building and seeing right into others apartments. Had to totally close blinds for any privacy. That blocked all of the natural lighting. A suggestion or 2: !. Letting people know where their room is located within the facility so they could ask for a different view if it was available. 2. Having blinds that pull up from the bottom (instead of down from the top) would allow some privacy from close buildings and still allow some natural light into the rooms that have this issue). Additionally some kind of break on parking would be a great addition. Our parking costs almost as much as one nights stay!. Good: Social Hour was unexpected and fun. Made some new friends!,2018
2.0,"Stayed a few days while on business, big mistake. I don't want an experience from my Hotel - I want value for my money. No Closet, No dressers, No coffee maker, No Frig, No Microwave, No Bathtub, No Iron, No ice machines, No room service, No Workspace and of course no free breakfast. They give you a poker chip for one free coffee or drink. It is geared towards those who don't need any of these amenities and want to hang out in a noisy bar environment for your computer work. They give you a small tray table about 15x15 inches to work on in your room, that doesn't cut it for me. I get the revenue play with putting more rooms in a much small piece of real estate but for the nightly cost, a business traveler can find much nicer hotels in Chicago. I would suggest an improvement would be to have a fold up table on the wall and a chair at least. Traveler beware if your are on business (especially a women) this is most likely not the place for you - unless you just want tacos and the free lollypop from room service. I think the Do Not Disturb sign with the young guy in his under ware hugging a teddy bear says it all.",2018

5.0,Good: Perfect hotel,2018
5.0,Good: Great location. Staff was amazing,2018
2.5,"Bad: The property tries so hard to be trendy that it actually made it very difficult to stay as a family. There was only one pillow each, three towels for four people and a tightly restricted supply of coffee- only two, environmentally unfriendly, pods. The oddest part was there were no teaspoons, only stirrers and amazingly no kettle- and only two mugs for four people. We had to bother house keeping just to bring a kettle up to make tea (also not supplied). This hotel sells trendy box water for 8 which pretty much sums up how far off the mark this place is with practicalities. Trendy sure, but practical and sensible...no. Reminded me of of a start up thats well funded but just silly. Also the rooms air conditioning setting included jet engine or off so that was extremely uncomfortable. I wouldnt stay here again given they also have an odd naughty drawer and I needed to explain to my 7 year old what sex dust was. Extremely odd place to stay as a family. Good: I liked that the lobby was filled with fun games and a great bar which was very relaxed and welcoming.",2018

4.8,Good: Excellent location. Staff very friendly. Bedroom very clean.,2018
4.6,Good: Fun and comfortable hotel in great location,2018
5.0,Bad: My preference for a mattress is more on the harder side so my back was rather sore in the mornings after waking up. But it seems like most American hotels have rather soft beds so I am not sure if this is something that bothers other people or not.,2018
4.0,We had a very good stay at this hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good. I had been worried about the breakfast because I had seen some reviews that hated the warm up eggs and breakfast sandwiches but I thought they were just fine and there were a few other good options. The only thing that sucks about the warm up sandwiches is the waste it makes. Itd be nice if the wrappings were recyclable.The only negative thing I would say is that the rooms are showing a need for a deep clean. There is dirt accumulating in the corners and soap scum on the shower shelves. The room in general was clean but definitely showed signs of cleanliness neglect if that makes sense. Location is excellent for two reasons. 1) central to all of the attractions which makes everything super walkable and 2) right across the street from Reading Terminal which was awesome!,2018
5.0,"The hotel is situated in the perfect spot for all the attractions, and within walking distance of most of them. The hotel was clean and just right for what we wanted, nothing too flashy, not overly expensive and very clean. We had a great view and could see the top of the Empire State Building from our window. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. The Subway was just around the corner and there were plenty of places to eat. Our stay at The Chelsea Savoy hotel was a happy one, we would definitely stay there again.",2018
2.0,"This hotel is barebones, ugly, and has zero amenities. The people were nice, it was clean, and the location is decent for someone who has business in the Loop. However, there are multiple other hotels right nearby that are much better.",2018
5.0,"I had a room on the 9th floor. Supposed to be a small room but in reality was very adequate with a king size bed. Comfortable, and total paid on booking.com was 88! I was walking distance to the Southshore train which I used to travel from Michigan City, Indiana. I arrived early, 10:45am, and I had planned to ask them to just hold my overnight bag, but they said my room was ready so I was checked in by 11 am! Wow! Every staff member was very helpful, and I enjoyed dinner at the Elephant and Castle restaurant affiliated with the hotel. Excellent food and beverage.",2018
4.0,The hotel was average but the price and location was very good the Hotel was very old like 90is the staff was helpful if u want to go to attend any show at convention centre then u are at right place its also near to strip only waking distance,2018
4.0,"This place is an average hotel. No casino, no room service, no glitz or glam. BUT it has clean rooms, clean pool w/free cabanas, a small nice restaurant, and nice staff. Location is next the Wynn and Encore close by Circus Circus. Across the street from a 24hr Walgreens and Dennys. I wouldnt call it a family place but its not bad for families. Some young and old partiers but not overly loud or obnoxious. If youre looking to go and dont need the pricey amenities then this place is right. It could use some updating but we werent in the room staring at the walls.",2018
5.0,"I would like to thank Guest Service Manager Rena for making my stay special. I had a very nice talk with her about her career at Marriott. She was quick to let me know how proud she is of her staff. She should be, they are wonderful. From the time I checked in, her entire staff made me feel welcome and very comfortable. Emily in the restaurant suggested a couple of her go to specials, and she was right on. Delicious!! The hotel was in immaculate condition. The rooms are large and very quiet. Sleeping on the road can be difficult. No problem here. I slept like a baby. Thank you again Rena.....I highly recommend this hotel for business travel, and family travel for all occasions.Hi Tom,Thank you so much for your outstanding review! Rena is well respected for her outstanding customer service and I'll be sure she is aware that you mentioned her in your review. I'm very happy that you were able to enjoy our in house restaurant, Palettes, and found the food to be delicious. I will also be sure to let Housekeeping know how happy you were with your room cleanliness and the clean public space.

5.0,Close to the river with shops and restaurants. Uber/taxi over and enjoy yourself for the night. They used to have a great full breakfast included but now it costs 16-bummer. Staff is helpful and polite. You are 10 minutes to downtown Napa.,2018
4.0,"We stayed at the Best Western Plus during our long weekend trip to Napa. It was perfectly fine for what we needed, a place to sleep after touring wineries! The room was very clean. We were on the second floor by the pool (not sure if all rooms face the pool) and it was good. Only had one instance where a group of loud girls were in the pool area and it was definitely loud in our room, but thankfully it didn't last long. Overall a quiet place. Got vouchers for Denny's next door, easy and fast breakfast before our days. I saw some reviews mentioning traffic due to the location, but it was always an easy in/out for us. Would definitely stay again if in the area, since it's a great place to rest after a busy day!",2018

3.0,"We stayed here before a Saints game with kids. Pros: Location was perfect for this - room was clean and large and the kids loved the games in the bar. The bar staff was particularly helpful and friendly. Cons: the front desk is understaffed and really slow, both check-in and check-out. The breakfast area ran out of almost all items and closed early. The hotel screwed up our pre-arranged late checkout and locked us out, and then gave us the wrong key TWICE. Long story, but the whole mix up ended up costing us 45+ minutes.Well that's certainly not the experience we hope to provide. We will be sure to share your feedback with our front office to ensure this is not an ongoing issue. We do hope you give us another shot next season! WHODAT!!Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",2018
3.0,"This was the first hotel we have ever stayed at that felt like you were sleeping inside of a walk-in closet the room had no window at all and was very claustrophobic we stayed in room 1701 and apparently from speaking to the front desk over 1/3 of the hotels rooms or exactly like this king room I feel that the hotel should forewarn you of these fax however they do not the staff was very friendly and accommodating the room was just not up to par like other Aloft hotels we have stayed at We do have 21 King rooms in the hotel that do not have a window and while they will run you the same price as our traditional kings, there is an option to choose this room. Be sure to check your confirmation when booking to ensure you've selected the correct room. We are thrilled to hear the staff was accommodating and we will be sure the front desk is confirming room types at check in.Thanks for your business, we hope you'll be back,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",2018
5.0,"Tried out Aloft for the ADA rooms. Pleasantly surprised spacious rooms updated features. We will look for the brand in our travels. The receptionist was very friendly and knowledgeable of the area. I was waiting for the concierge to give a breakfast recommendation and she was busy so the receptionist gave us a few with different styles and directions turned out great. Thank you Aloft for a great stayDelighted to hear of your stay with us and appreciate your feedback on our ADA rooms. We hope you will stay with us again in the future,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",2018
4.0,"Loved the convenience of staying in this CBD hotel which is so close to the French Quarter but without the price. Hotel is kinda minimalist but rooms were clean. Only reason four instead of five stars is the hallways and my room smelled kinda like a sweaty, bad-smelling locker room. I said something to the hotel and then the smell was gone. Thanks so much for your review. We are happy to hear we were able to resolve that issue you for you while here and hope youll be back again soon. Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",2018
4.0,"The hotel is very confortable, besides breakfast they offer wine tasting in the afternoons. The price is a bit expensive and the hotel stay a bit far from downtown Napa, so a car is required. Parking is free, which is a plus.",2018

5.0,"What a beautiful Hampton Inn in Napa. Great Location within walking distance of a movie theatre, gym, a few restaurants and Starbucks. The rooms are a nice size. The beds were comfy. They had DirecTv which is always a huge Plus! But the bathroom was awesome. Love, love, love the extra lighting and shelving for us ladies. The only thing I would add would be a wall magnifying mirror like the Marriott has. Even with all the amazing light it was hard to get up close to the mirror to do my makeup because of the size of the nice vanity.",2018

5.0,Everything about our stay from the moment we checked in was a very positive experience. Our room was clean and had everything we needed. The pool area was also nice and clean with plenty of towels and loungers available. The breakfast area was also clean and well attended to. We were also given a one hour late checkout which made my daughter extremely happy as it gave her a chance for one more swim before we left. A perfect stay while we were in the Keys!Thank you for the five star review. So glad to hear our folks at the front office were able to extend a later departure so your daughter could get that one last swim!! Thank you for sharing your experience and we look forward to welcoming you back to our little island!,2018
4.0,"If you're familiar with Key West, you'll recognize the location as the old Day's Inn. But the changes are more than just the signage. I figured it would be a new sign and fresh paint. Not so. A number of years back, numerous hotels on the entry end of the island were taken out of the inventory for revitalization, including the Days Inn. They gutted it, and the changes are significant.The room was large, as was the bath. Just a shower, no tub in room 148, which was fine. Bed was comfy, a/c worked great. In fact, I had no complaints at all about this property. The complimentary breakfast included pork sausage, turkey sausage, scrambled eggs, omelets, make your own waffles, plus pastries and fresh fruit. Not your typical complimentary breakfast.Pool is large enough, and plenty of lounges, as well as canopies. There's a Tiki Bar and music playing. Now for what may be a concern for some.The hotel is at the entry to the island. All traffic on or off the island passes through the intersection out front. Since the hospital is on Stock Island (just next to Key West) ambulances going there, pass right by. Sirens don't bother me, but if you get upset over them....well, since the island is 2 miles by 4 miles, maybe this isn't the place for you. There were numerous sirens from law enforcement, fire, and ambulances each day, but I didn't notice them at night.I had no complaints about this place. The only shortfalls, were that there was only one wastebasket in the room, which was next to the computer desk. Another in the bath would have been nice. Also, the parking spaces were a bit narrow, but nothing I couldn't deal with.Front desk and all staff were great. Property gets a recommended!Please note: There are two Fairfield Inns on the island. One at 2400 N. Roosevelt, and this one at 3800.Thank you for the very detailed review. We truly appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with our readers. Glad to hear you had time to enjoy our breakfast and enjoy some sun poolside. We look forward to welcoming you back to the Keys Collection!",2018

Really How did this get on Priceline in the first place And how did it get any stars I am only writing this now because it is 1:30 in the morning and my dorm was like a library compared to this place. Decades ago. How did this get on Priceline I have stayed at more than 40 hotels in Chicago on Priceline over the years, but this is the first time I have stayed in a hostel. A hostile. Really I wish zero stars was a choice, but that would be too many. I know all the hipster comments I will get on this, but please, keep them to yourself.Hello Steve P, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay.

5.0,"It's been my 12th-time stay at The Nolitan Hotel, of which I call home away from home. Here is why I keep coming back: 1. The staff is lovely, service oriented and overall great! 2. The rooms are clean, new and made by the best materials and in the exact size, you need for a short stay in the city. 3. The location is by far the best in terms of distance from subway, best stores (Ayr, KOIO, Outdoor Voices, DryBar) Restaurants (Mikakus Sushi, SweetGreens and Jacks Wife Freda)4. By far my favorite hotel in the city!Thank you Daniel for the review! As always we love to host you at the Nolitan! Let us know when you will be back )Best Regards.",2018
2.0,"We arrived at the hotel feeling positive about the location and warm-ish greeting at reception. This feeling did not last long. The pillows were really uncomfortable, both of the taps were hot, the AC was so loud and made a buzzing noise (we asked twice to have this fixed and nothing changed), the fire alarm went off at 3am and there was never really an excuse given as to what was going on, then (because we'd had no sleep) we put the 'do not disturb' sign on and the cleaner banged on our door repeatedly shouting 'housekeeping' until we answered. The water was shut off one evening from 11pm-3am which meant that when we had to go to the toilet it sat there for hours. No one informed us where a smoking area was so we assumed there was not one... this meant that we smoked out the front and got disturbed, bugged and pushed by homeless people asking for money, cigerettes, etc. It really was just one thing after the other. The cups were so rubbish that they leaked, my oartner hit his head on the shower because of a stupid bar across the top and they charged 50 dollars a night for a hold This was not really made clear at the beginning and I was left wondering why I was missing so much from my account. I have stayed in many hotels, hostels, bnbs over the years and had just stayed in 4 other places, all were LESS money and gave a better, quality experience.",2018
5.0,"Overall this is a great property. The lobby, restaurant, and hotel rooms are really well done. Lots of nice touches with great designs. Tons of character here. We stayed in a double queen room which we thought had plenty of space. The gym is located between two floors and has a Peloton bike and the hotel provides the shoes. As a cycling, I thought this was awesome. I already had a Peloton login. The music in the gym, however, was too loud and we called to have it turned down and the staff couldn't figure out how to do it. The staff were all friendly and courteous - bellhops, front desk staff and concierge all included. Location very convenient to a number of places downtown. Beds and pillows were comfortable. TVs changed channels without the annoying 1 second delay at most other hotels. There's some construction going on at the property next door to be aware of, but it's New York and good luck finding somewhere without construction. Definitely recommend.Dear chitripguy, Thank you very much for your detailed and wonderful review. I am so glad you enjoyed our property from our comfortable rooms and the gym. We pride ourselves in service and i'm very happy to read you've enjoyed your stay. Hopefully we get to welcome you back again in the future!Warmest Regards, Nick HaferGeneral Manager",2018
1.0,"We travel to Six Flags over GA pretty frequently. This was our first and last time for staying at this hotel. I'm generally a 4-5 star reviewer of hotels, with the occasional 3 star, here and on Trip Advisor, but this was my worst experience. There are plenty of problems with this place, but I'll start with the pros:Pro: Location to 6 Flags and room comfort. Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us. We continually try to do our very best for all of our guests, but unfortunately, sometimes we do fail. I will look into each issue that you have noted, in an attempt to correct and improve our hotel policies. Sincerely, Hotel Manager",2018
2.0,"The staff was really friendly and helpfull The loccation of the hotel is great cause its only two blocks from central park , two blocks from the subway and within walking distance from cafes and restaurants The building is really old and uncleen and needs reinovation NOW ! The kitchen and everything in it was too dirty to use Wifi was available only at the lobby There was an area to chill like living room on -1 but was too spooky to chill I stayed on the 4th floor , the door of my room was broken and was really difficult to open and close The room and the bathroom were old but clean enough Also the matress and pilow was too small Finaly the heat on the room was too strong and you couldn't control it so you couldn't stay in the room nor sleep",2018
3.0,"To be fair I went into this hotel with high expectations based off of multiple stays at the Redbury in LA. Its my go to in LA because of how amazing it is - it is my third or fourth hotel in the US hands down. The Redbury NYC doesnt compare. The hotel itself a little unkempt. Not in a trendy vintage way but in a needs some TLC way. We stayed in a deluxe double, the beds are really small, view was bleh, and there was a lot of construction across the street so it was noisy on our side early in the morning (not the fault of the hotel obviously) I can handle all the above and it wouldnt have been an issue however the service is what was so disappointing to me. The bellhop (if you can call him that) was rude and mumbled things under his breath after I asked for help to get luggage to the room. Note: I had to ask - when I was clearly walking in with two daughters and luggage. We called to the front to ask for cutlery, they said they would check and see if they had any and bring it up twenty minutes later my husband had to go and get it. We never heard from them. No one was overly friendly with the exception of two staff one being the housekeeper who was cleaning the rooms on the 6th floor when we checked in. She had great energy and went out of her way to ask what we needed and if she could help in any way. And the second was a gentleman who answered the concierge call when we had a few questions about parking. Outside of that this hotel really needs to step up there customer service game. See also my review of Marta. Same theme, very flat, non- engaging staff. Delicious pizza though. So its almost like you have a great product but your front line isnt selling it. Overall average which is disappointing for this brand. Thank you for sharing your feedback, Domenica.We regret that your experience with us was less than ideal. We're disappointed to hear the service you received wasn't up to par. Providing our guests with exceptional service is something we take seriously.

2.0,"The photo's looked fantastic. Our room however was not. The, a/c in the room was sellotaped into the window and was so noisy we couldn't sleep. Rooms were small. View was invisible due to the filthy windows and construction work opposite. The shower leaked and flooded the bathroom. The sink had no plug. No table or chest of drawers or anything in the room. This is in my opinion is scraping a 3 star if that definitely not a 4.We appreciate the feedback, Russell.We're disappointed that your stay with us was less than ideal. It's unfortunate you've noticed a decline in the quality of our accommodations, and that you had such challenges with your room.

3.0,"Great breakfast buffet each morning. Definitely adds value to the price. But otherwise, not a great stay. I think their cleaning crew must be understaffed. One day they didn't take out our trash or give us bath rugs or hand towels. The six of us in a two bedroom suite shared towels and used a washcloth -- a washcloth! -- for a rug. The next day we didn't get any maid service at all! At 6:00 pm, we went downstairs and asked for our own towels. The little market store downstairs was sold out of bottled water for two of our five day stay. Not having water after a long day of city walking was a real disappointment. And there is no easy market or store within walking distance, so we were chugging tap water. Yuck. My son got sick one night, so we hoped for ginger ale or Sprite or something to settle his stomach. Nope. All they had was Mountain Dew.The location across from Lake Union was pretty, but not convenient for downtown activities. We had to wait up to 20 minutes for an Uber driver during peak hours. That was poor planning on my part to book here, but I had no idea that Uber would be so difficult. Despite the challenges, we did have a decent stay. Our two room suite was spacious and comfortable. And again, the breakfast was really fantastic.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your recent stay with us and providing your honest feedback. On behalf of our team, I apologize we fell short of meeting our expectations but most importantly yours. It is guest as yourself who help improve our hotel and provide better service in the future.

5.0,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights in April, coming from Victoria on the Clipper. The hotel was very conveniently located, just four blocks from the ferry terminal. We were met by Lee, who was very courteous, and very helpful with suggestions and directions for sightseeing and restaurants. The room was very nice, and very quiet. We enjoyed happy hour in the lobby, and we had one dinner in the restaurant downstairs. The ambience is very retro. The front-desk and cleaning staff were wonderful. We could do all of the sightseeing we wanted on foot. Chihuly Garden and Glass was a highlight. Highly recommended.Dear Guest,Thank you for this fantastic review! Our location really is ideal for 'on-foot' sightseeing of the Chihuly Museum/Space Needle as well the Pike Place Market. Nice when we are perfectly placed in the middle of these two iconic spots! Your kudos for Lee are so appreciated as well. We pride ourselves on making guests feel as if they've traveled to a home away from home, so it would be our greatest honor to welcome you back as our guests again in the future. Please feel free to reach out to me directly when you consider your next trip to Seattle :)Best Regards,David Bayley",2018

3.0,"Be aware that this hotel is currently being renovated. My room itself was OK, though the bathroom didnt seem like the renovation was finished. Poorly installed sockets and a cracked shower unit. The peephole on the door wasnt complete and had a Kleenex stuffed in it. I assume the construction also affected the breakfast, which was way below the style I expect at a La Quinta. Rate was too high for the level of room and breakfast provided. Dear Traveler, Thank you for taking the time to post a review on behalf of your stay with. We apologize that some of the renovations were taking place during your stay. It is through your feedback that we are able to improve what we do. It is our hope you will come back and see us again.

4.0,"This Residence Inn is kind of out of no where - it's pretty far from the center of city and has lots developments in the area. That being said, there are good restaurants/coffeeshops around within 3-5 mins drive. Their price for the room in summer is GREAT! Not sure if I would pay for what they ask for in spring though.Dear Jui-Yu C,Thank you for choosing the Residence Inn Phoenix North/Happy Valley for your recent travels to Phoenix. Commitment to service and guest satisfaction is a main focus and we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay.

4.0,"I had to attend a meeting here and decided to stay the night. The room was clean and the staff was pleasant. Nice pool andJacuzzi. Coffee shop also served Starbucks coffee but had their own sandwiches which were really good and worth the price. Most of the other guests there also had breakfast there rather than in the nearby mall and were happy with their orders as well. The mall is also quite near, walking distance with a wide selection of food.",2018
1.0,"I had a surprisingly disappointing stay at what I thought was supposed to be a nice hotel. We were moving apartments close by, and I booked a 3 night stay. The service was almost non-existent. We asked for a crib before check-in, then again three separate times after we checked in. It finally arrived after 11 PM! We asked for silverware so that we could eat our room service. Never brought it. We ended up eating with coffee stirrers in the room. No one offered a smile or hello, or offered to open a door when I was coming through with a stroller. The rooms are very dated. Overall, just a very disappointing stay. It seems like this hotel is just resting on a famous name.Dear LK198200,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. While we wish you had a better experience, it is feedback like this that we learn from and use to improve. We work hard to deliver an exceptional guest experience, and it's apparent in this case that we fell short. It is important to us to do what we can to make amends for your stay. If you would like to further discuss your visit, please don't hesitate to reach out to our Hotel Manager, Massimiliano Puglisi, directly at Massimiliano.PuglisiRosewoodhotels.com. If you give us a chance to earn back your trust, I can assure you that we will do our best to give you the great hotel experience that so many of our guests have grown so fond of.

5.0,"We arrived at the beginning of July for a 7 night stay. Check in was quick staff friendly. We were upgraded to a room with a kingsize bed given free wifi on the 11th floor.Throughout our stay our room was kept spotless with fresh towels and shampoos etc refilled on a daily basis. On our last day we were able to stay in our room until 13.00hrs at no extra charge then our suitcases stored by the staff for 1 per case.We asked about purchasing a jar of cookies to bring home but unfortunately they were not available until 17.00hrs, however seeing the disappointment on our faces Jessica went the extra mile spoke with management we were able to purchase two tins We also were given a few free ones to have on our journey home!We will definitely return to this hotel when we are next back in New York.

Andrew the front desk guy was awesome and sent us a bottle of champagne after I told him why we were here. The room was nice and spacious and the shower is on another level. There are lots of restaurants near by and places to walk to. The light rail is right next to the hotel so it was super easy to get to the restaurants and bars further downtown. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you Andrew for making our stay amazing!Hello Amanda D, We thought you were pretty amazing too!

The ambiance of the hotel I would describe as urban chic boutique-style luxury art gallery hotel. The location is wonderful for exploring the charming neighborhood and nearby downtown. The service was excellent. Brunch was delicious in the charming restaurant. Bottom line - it combines a fun, happening atmosphere with a great stay. I doubt we'd look anywhere else in the future.

Breakfast was stocked and the staff members there were quick to clean and help out. I was really blown away by everyone's attitude.

4.0,"I had planned a last minute trip in to Anaheim to go for a Birthday event at Disney, the entire city was sold out but Townplace had a few rooms available. We generally dont stay this far away from Disney but we had no choice. Room rates were out of control because of a conference and most hotels were sold out! I have to say we were pleasantly surprised with the hotel. My experience at check -in was fantastic, the rooms were clean the energy was good and overall we didn't care that we were a few miles away from Disney. We Were happy with our stay. The only thing I could say that I was not crazy about was the commuter train that passes through the back of the Hotel.

2.0,Overall we are Marriott Gold Elite members and have the Marriott credit card so we really do Marriott all the time but this is one of the locations that has very poor upkeep. Our room had a funny mold smell and the sink and shower did not drain properly there was the toilet paper roll that was broken a picture frame was not mounted correctly and fell to the floor. The microwave was mounted not at a level. And the list goes on...Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts regarding this issue. We appreciate you bringing it to our attention. We will share your message appropriately within the organization. Edgar RiveraGeneral Manager,2018
5.0,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at XV Beacon. All of the staff was friendly and attentive. The location is perfect for exploring Boston and for anywhere a little further, a driving service is offered. The driver, Mark, was very friendly and made sure to point out notable sites along the drive. The rate is expensive, but we enjoyed the high-level of service with multiple tidy services offered each day. The room was very comfortable for us.",2018
4.0,The hotel itself is lovely and the staff were very kind and helpful. Just a couple of downsides the shower gel was low throughout our stay and you could get hardly any out i was a bit surprised this wasn't checked during housekeeping. The shower itself also wasn't very powerful. We had a clock in the room but it wasn't showing the right time and appeared to be out of battery didnt think this looled very good. The air conditioning was quite noisy but you could get a good temperature. We enjoyed our stay though as i said just a few minor things.,2018
5.0,Nice place with a great staff. This place is clean and well maintained. Being Massachusetts there are no alcoholic beverages during the managers reception. The breakfast was great too. The bar remains open until midnight and is a great place to unwind after visiting the city.,2018

4.0,"Very nice staff. (They must have fired all the the rude people I read about in the reviews. LOL) Safe area (for New Orleans. For the people who said it was in a bad neighborhood, this is not Mayberry. ) The cost was a bit excessive in my opinion. Over 250 for one night ( although that did include parking. and it was an event weekend.) The facilities are nice. You can sit on the wrought iron balcony and watch the French Quarter wake up. The location is convenient and close to everything. The only reason this is not a 5 star review is that the shower was dirty. For that kind of money, I at least want to wash my old behind in a clean shower. The bed was VERY FIRM. It was too firm for my wife and me, but I hear some people like firm mattresses, so this would be right up your ally if you do. The second floor seems to be the best as far as views, I think. Third floor could be a beating on older folks because of the stairs. Also, there are two seperate hotels. I saw where a lady was complaining about having to walk from the office to another building. This is because she went to the wrong one, initially. There is French Quarter Suites, and New Orleans Courtyard Hotel. I think the NO Courtyard is a little higher end. Overall good experience. I will be back, but not on an event weekend.",2018
4.0,"This is a lovely hotel where one is made to feel very welcome. An extra bonus (for cat lovers, at least) is Claire, the resident cat. The hotel is ideally located for exploring the utterly charming French Quarter. Our room was beautiful and very comfortable but as this is an old building, it is not very soundproof and other guests talking in the courtyard and entryway and wheeling their luggage around disturbed us early each morning - at 4am during the first night. The Frette linens and Molton Brown toiletries were much appreciated luxury touches. We were however disappointed by the breakfast - we ordered toast in preference to biscuits and one slice of toast each seemed rather meagre. Be warned - the coffee is flavoured with chicory - a New Orleans tradition but not to our taste. I would recommend this as a place to stay if you are happy to put up with the quirks of an old building but suggest eating breakfast elsewhere.We usually do have pure coffee in the freezer. We don't get many requests but we try to stay prepared. You simply needed to request it. I doubt that anyone could find breakfast spots in New Orleans that serve pure coffee. New Orleans traditional caf au lait is French roasted chicory coffee served with an equal part of warm milk. That is what we serve. That is what Caf du Monde serves. We are famous for our buttermilk biscuits but we do keep gluten free and whole grain bread for the guests who don't eat white flour. I do apologize that you were served only two slices of toast. An order of biscuits if four therefore an order of toast should also be at least four.Please if your travels bring you back to New Orleans give us another try. In addition to the tea , hot chocolate and iced coffee that are always available we will brew pure for you each morning. We will also give you a room on the second or third floor or even on the other side of the street so if we have late arrivals or early departures you won't be disturbed.Claire would be disappointed if you went elsewhere and so would I",2018
5.0,"Even before I arrived at Soniat I had an insight into the warm hospitality that was the theme throughout our stay. From the warm, helpful welcome from Mark and his coleague, to the professional manner of Calvin, the housekeepers and the managers, they could not do enough. I hesistate to use the term hotel to describe Soniat, that's like calling Buckingham palace a house. The rooms are luxurious, I really want that bed in my home. Situated on a peaceful street, with a church next door, and well situated to get around the French quarter, and other attractions. Everything is quaint, peaceful, and friendly, a haven. The setting is beautiful courtyards, with water features, classical music played softly, and a well stocked honour bar, what more could you want...wait did I mention breakfast No meals are served apart from breakfast and I absolutley rate it as a five star experience, my first taste of American biscuits was fab, they have to be the best biscuits, fresh orange juice, great coffee (apologies I'm drooling just thinking about it). It was a great choice, we hope to be back and I am more than willing to recommend it to anyone looking for an oasis of calm, warm hospitality. Go, you won't regret it.Wow!You have made my day!What a kind and thoughtful review. Thank you so very much for taking the time.It would be a real pleasure to welcome you back.",2018

1.0,"Very old hotel that caters to low class clientele. Being near Disneyland, this hotel is a fly trap to families who cannot afford something nicer. There were children running around all hours of the night and day and the hotel staff did nothing to keep them quiet. Our first night there we had a family above us with small children who kept running around the room and because of the noise we assume they were jumping off the furniture. We complained to the hotel staff and nothing was done to stop this. It continued until well after 11 PM and night.The second night we were there, we had a family with small children next door to us and it was apparent from what we saw, they were there with other families who also had small children. They were kept there doors open and the children were running up and down the balcony with no supervision. At 6 AM the next morning, someone was pounding on the door next to us very loudly and yelling fire, fire, fire. It woke up the people next to us so they opened there door and began to play loud rap music until about approximately 9 AM when we left. We were on the second floor near the office and all of this activity was extremely loud and had to have been heard at the office, but no action was taken to stop it.I would never stay at this hotel again!!!!Thank you for taking the time to write us a review. We are extremely sorry for the experience you had at our hotel. This is not something normal. I am also suprised our staff did not address the issue immediately.

A friend got us two rooms at Rodeway Inn Qualcomm at a discounted rate to help us with travel expenses. We received our confirmations 15 days prior to check in.On the very morning we left for San Diego, we received a phone call from the manager of Rodeway Inn Qualcomm telling us we were not eligible for the discounted rooms, and our reservations had been cancelled. There was no offer to keep the reservations at the standard rate the reservations had simply been cancelled and the rooms were no longer available. When asked why he would do this on the day we were due to check in, the manager basically told us he did it because he could.We understand that hotel policies may limit the availability of discounted rooms, but we should have been notified earlier so we could make other arrangements.

4.0,"We had a corner suite on the 8th floor this past weekend and were pleasantly surprised by the large size of the room and bathroom. Upon check-in, we were told that the pool and roof bar were on the 9th floor. We had concerns about possible noise only being one floor down, but our stay was very quiet throughout the weekend. Pluses:The room was very clean and nicely furnished. Customer service was excellent. We called the front desk to request a fridge for medication and it was delivered within 5 minutes. We also saw a couple gift items in the gift store early on Sunday morning before our flight out but the shop had not opened yet. The manager was kind enough to open the store for us an hour beforehand so that we could make our purchases. The hotel is only a short 5-10 mins walk from the French Quarter. High quality, soft toilet paper and high quality toiletries and linens provided. Nice brushed nickel finishes in the bathroom. Complimentary water in the room.Minor Issues:King-sized bed was a bit lumpy and sagged except for the middle. We would have preferred a smoother, firmer mattress. The power buttons and volume buttons on both remote controls for the TVs did not function. The next day, we finally found the joystick button on the bottom middle frame of each TV to control the volume and power. We did not use the pool, but it is very small.We are delighted you enjoyed your time at NOPSI. Let us know when you are travelling back to NOLA and we will ensure your stay is most memorable. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",2018
5.0,"We booked Nopsi for my 40th birthday and this hotel lived up to my expectations. My spouse is a lifetime Marriott Platinum member so we have had our fair share of hotel stays. The service and hospitality was amazing. The staff was courteous without feeling stuffy...the best way to describe them was authentic with a large does of Southern hospitality and they were all wonderful.They upgraded us to a better room which comprised of a wrap around view. The upgrade was complimentary even though they were fully booked. Two thumbs up and what a wonderful way to kick-off my birthday.The hotel bed is amazing. I described it as feeling hugged but not hot. I received the best sleep and my spouse said the same. I'm a side sleeper and he's a back sleeper so it's shocking that we both like the mattress.The bed was so comfortable that I emailed the hotel to get the make of the mattress and will order it for our own home.We frequented the lobby bar and the drinks were on point.I don't recall the name of my drink but it reminded me of salty plum but our bartender described it as vinegary. Personally, I thought it was well-balanced. The Frenchman was also well-made here. The rooftop bar was a scene but not compared to Orange County or LA. Much less pretentious and the skyline was pleasant.As others have mentioned, the hotel is not in the middle of the action but walking distance to Bourbon St and many of the best local restaurants (GW Fins being my fav for the grilled oysters and desserts).Bottom line, I would stay here again the next time we are in NOLA.Sara, thank you so much for choosing to stay at NOPSI! Its wonderful to learn that you had such a fun and memorable 40th birthday with us. We love making all occasions special, and were delighted to have won you over. A terrace room overlooking the city certainly provides an unforgettable experience. We hope you and your husband will make visiting us an annual birthday tradition so that we may treat you to more pleasant surprises!Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",2018
5.0,"Our holiday stay at the NOPSI was PERFECT! The hotel and the architecture are spectacular. The staff, from housekeeping to management, was professional, efficient, polite and friendly. The service was just as one would expect from a luxury hotel. I can't say enough about the bartenders at all 3 bars. They were knowledgeable mixologists, friendly and efficient. The view from the rooftop bar is grand and so is the atmosphere. The lobby bar is beautiful and the live music in the evenings was a wonderful treat. Room service was delivered quicker than anticipated and was delicious! Our breakfasts were first class! The 3 egg omelet Pontchartrain, Porchetta Hash and Eggs, Pecan Belgian Waffles and 1/2 Ruby Grapefruit Brle were the best room service meals I believe my husband and I have ever had for breakfast. The room service wait staff was polite and friendly. Although we did not dine at Public Service during this stay, we have in the past and found the food and service to be exemplary. Christmas morning we were greeted with a stocking hanging on our door. The stocking was filled with fresh fruit, candy and baked goods. What a wonderful surprise! The accommodations were beautiful and comfortable. My husband is generally very uncomfortable sleeping in hotel beds and lounging on hotel furniture, but he was very comfortable during our stay at the NOPSI. He was so pleased, that he has already booked the hotel for a return business trip in the near future. Love this beautiful hotel in my favorite city! Can't wait to return.Sharon, Thank you for sharing your wonderful review on TripAdvisor. I am thrilled that you enjoyed a little lagniappe on Christmas morning as well as phenomenal service throughout your stay. It is an honor to be your hotel of choice in New Orleans. Our team looks forward to welcoming you again on your next visit. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",2018
5.0,"The hotel was new and fresh and loved the fact the old, city, utilities building was repurposed and refreshed. The staff was friendly and everyone helpful. The location was far enough away from the French Quarter to be quiet but still within a 10 minute walk. Class Act all the way!It's great to hear from you and I'm glad you had a fantastic stay at our hotel. Your comments to location and staff are gratefully received and we hope to welcome you back soon.Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",2018

3.0,"Hotel work in progress. Pretty enough and nice roof top bar. Tiny gym. Terrible WiFi and worse service and effort in dining room. Its not a great deal with these issues. If they care they can improve but not clear they do. Also my room was not clean until 6 on the day we checked in forcing us to wait 2 hours. Thank you for choosing NOPSI! We appreciate your feedback. I am disappointed to hear that service did not meet your expectations. If travels should bring you back, we would love the opportunity to demonstrate our service levels in the future.Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",2018

5.0,"This location is perfect: it's walking distance to the French Quarter and to the Business District, yet it's far enough away from the craziness of Bourbon Street that you can get some sleep, if that's your thing. Everyone is very friendly. Rooms are modern and comfortable. Nice shower. The bed was a tiny bit too soft for my liking, but it didn't tarnish my experience in the least.Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us as we appreciate hearing how much you enjoyed our property and service provided.

5.0,"A little pricey, however the location and service was excellent. Breakfast is not the best, at least as a Diamond level is complementary. I highly recommend this property, location, staff and rooms are excellent. Thank you for taking the time to write this review of your stay and we are delighted to know you enjoyed almost everything about your stay. We are currently transitioning our restaurant and trying out some new items and processes, please know that the breakfast service will improve as this is a main priority.

5.0,"We were taken aback by the staff, especially Jalan who since we walked in took care of us. We felt like royalty! They secured a bottled of champagne and treats for our 22nd wedding anniversary ... so very kind! The hotel is lovely, a boutique stay with a Hilton flair. Its modern but not over the top. Very clean and very comfortable with a great rooftop bar. It is not in the French Quarter so beware we actually liked that as we know NOLA well. Surely a destination to be considered. Thank you for taking the time to write this wonderful review of your anniversary celebration at our hotel. We love to hear back when we not only meet but exceed expectations. Jalan is certainly a rising star on our staff and has been commended for his efforts in taking great care of you. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest and hope to have you back for another visit very soon.Sincerely,",2018

1.0,"Toilet paper is like sandpaper. Billed for charges that even the staff can not explain and having to make numerous repeat calls to get corrected. A week later and STILL not corrected. If you stay, get your bill before you leave the property! Coffee was offered in lobby first day and then STOPPED Seems as if the restaurant is struggling and they wanted people to purchase coffee vs offer. Pitiful. One of the worst hotel stays I have had, especially from a Hilton. Location is not the best eitherThank you for taking the time to share this feedback and we apologize for any issues you encountered during your stay. Your feedback is very important to us and so please contact me directly to discuss further so that I can address accordingly.Regards,",2018
5.0,"My husband and I decided to head South to spend our April 2018 birthdays in New Orleans. Our stay at the Troubadour was perfect. The entire staff (especially Jalen at the front desk and bellman) made our trip memorable and worth a return stay. This will be our home away from home whenever we're visiting New Orleans. Oh, and the buffet was simply marvelous!Thank you very much for choosing The Troubadour to celebrate your birthdays with us and we are delighted to know you had such a great time.

5.0,"Had a fantastic stay at the Troubadour. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with suggestions for restaurants. The hotel was clean and modern. The only negative was that the walls are very thin but didn't bother us too much. Everything else well surpassed my expectations. Thank you very much for the five star review!!! We love to hear that we exceeded just about all expectations which is our ultimate goal with all of our guests. Please know that our walls were actually built thicker than what was recommended for a hotel when we completed this renovation, may have been a case of noisy neighbors that we could always try to assist with once reported.We appreciate you staying with us and do hope to have you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,",2018
5.0,"This hotel was awesome the rooms were great the staff was awesome the location was perfect the only draw back to this hotel is the 40 for valet parking however there are other cheaper options close to the hotel the roof top bar was really cool the breakfast was excellent overall the hotel gets a 97 out of 100 score from meThank you so much for taking the time to share this great review of your stay and we are delighted to know how much you enjoyed our property and service provided. There are cheaper options of parking around the area which is due to them having less labor and security costs than ours but yes they are conveniently located should guests decide to utilize those options. Your business and feedback are very important to us and we look forward to having you stay with us again whenever your travels bring you back to New Orleans.Best regards,",2018
4.0,"Carl was great. Carl was the concierge and he helped us with touring New Orleans. The rooftop was the best part of the hotel. It had a stylish bar and a view of the city that you only get from this hotel Thank you so much for taking the time to share this feedback about your recent stay with us and we are delighted to know you had an excellent stay. You are correct in stating how wonderful the view is from our Monkey Board Rooftop Bar and also about the job Carl does as our concierge. We appreciate having you stay with us and hope to have you back for another stay real soon.Best regards,",2018
5.0,"I love this hotel. It was cheaper than the ones - Sheraton and Marriott on Canal - where a conference I was attending was held. The decor is beautiful (Erykah Badu-like art on the wall and retro galore with a bit of artisan flare). My room was at the end of the corner and I didn't hear a thing, a privilege when traveling in a major city. The front desk manager called later to see if I had a good stay. Shout-out to Kavana at the front desk who was kind up my check out and departure as well as the people working in the first floor restaurant. The endive salad and fish was a perfect meal. The roof top bar looked like a lot of fun, but aside from a quick snap shot, I didn't stay as I needed to decompress from my travels. But I shall return. 12-15 minute safe walk to the Quarter. Take Rampart or any parallel street to Canal and head toward river.Thank you for taking the time to review our property and we are delighted to know you had a great stay with us. It sounds like every part of your experience at our hotel was perfect which is music to our ears. We certainly appreciate you staying with us and look forward to having you back as our guest whenever your travels bring you back to Nola.Best regards,",2018
5.0,"The art deco decor and large floor to ceiling windows created a festive yet zen atmosphere. There was a hiccup upon check-in with the system being down but generally speaking, service was great and staff very friendly. After check-out I realized I was charged for something incorrectly and Chris addressed it immediately and was able to correct it without hesitation. Great location and intimate feel came with friends but will revisit with spouse.Thank you so much for taking the time to review your recent stay with us and we are delighted to know you had a great stay.

2.0,"Not up to HHonors standards. Beautiful property, nice rooms and bath room nice clean carpets and bedding / bed comfort. But, NO HOT WATER for 25 minutes - each morning. Yes, we were told to wait 20+ minutes for the hot water to get up to the room level. And, the internet didn't connect, so we (my traveling partner - in another room) had to use the 'staff' WiFi with their password.Thank you for taking the time to share this feedback and we do apologize for not meeting expectations during your recent stay. I will review all aspects of design and address accordingly to ensure our guests enjoy their time as our guests. The boiler at our hotel did experience a mechanical issue that we addressed as quickly as possible but this did however cause our guests to experience no hot water for a period of time. Please know that this was not due to anything other than bad luck and timing. Our boiler is very new and plenty big enough for our hotel, this was an isolated issue that has been corrected moving forward. We are however happy to hear that you felt safe and secure while staying with us and do hope to have you back as our guests the next time you travel to New Orleans. Sincerely,",2018
5.0,"Very pretty hotel. There was Wonderful lady at the check in desk and she handled everything with ease. We had a little bit of an issue but she was so great she didnt make it an issue. The room was spacious and quiet. Everyone and I mean everyone was helpful and friendly. The rooftop bar called The Monkey Board was so terrific. Saturday night was a fun dance party and Sunday afternoon we enjoyed the sun and had some of the most delicious crawfish i have ever had. Thank you so much for this fantastic review of your stay and please know that it has been shared among our team.

4.0,"Clean, comfortable bed and modern dcor. A very nice rooftop bar but there are times this place gets too busy for the number of employees, so services gets a 7 (from 1-10) Good value on alcohol.The breakfast service is super good, the have a buffet style and fresh omelette's made to order. Must say this hotel does not really cater to the business traveler, no comfortable desk area in room, no place to make a few copies (i.e. business center) For a vacationer this is super great place, clean, location and good staff.Thank you for taking the time to share this review of your stay and for providing this feedback. Please know that this will be shared among our team leaders as we work to improve in all areas so that all guests have what they need to thoroughly enjoy their stay.

5.0,"The Troubadour was an awesome hotel for us! I absolutely LOVED the decor. The bed side tables couldnt be beat! The roof top bar was an incredible view and it was even more special because thats where my boyfriend proposed! I couldnt ask for a better view. Its a nice central location and the food market next door was awesome! The only thing I wish was better was the valet service. They werent very timely and one of them gave us serious attitude. Other than that it was incredible and I would 100 go back!! Thank you so much for taking the time to share this lovely review of your stay with us at The Troubadour.

1.0,"I was charged 244 for a one night stay in a very average room, I expected far better for the price sadly this is a similar standard of a holiday inn or days inn who are far cheaper. Staff were friendly enough, reception appeared to be under construction, I shall not be using this Marriott againThank you for your recent comments regarding the hotel. I understand the importance of receiving a value of staying in a downtown hotel, and Im sorry you didnt feel you received that value while staying in the hotel. At this time, the hotel is undergoing a major re-imaging of the lobby space and exterior with additional plans to begin the rooms and fitness area. Once this is completed, I hope you will give us another opportunity so you may see the value of the location and to gain your loyalty. Thank you again for your feedback.",2018
4.0,"This hotel is on a well-known avenue and literally across Lake Union. You can see from your hotel room window all of the lake tours available and boats to rent. So many people walking, jogging, and biking around the lake. Make sure you go for a lake view room. Just down the street there are some good places to eat like a BBQ place and Art Mable 21 restaurant. The staff is the best, very helpful and friendly. What I enjoyed the most was their breakfast Acai bowl, so good and an energy boost to start the day right. WiFi is always free and I had no issues.Dear EndyBOSTON,Thank you for sharing your feedback! I am glad to hear that you enjoyed your time at our hotel with the surrounding area being active and upbeat, matching the mood and view of the beautiful Lake Union. The Bistro's Acai Bowls are the best and I'm happy you had a chance to enjoy them at the top of your morning here.

2.0,"The location of this place is prime. The hotel condition, on average is nice. I found my room fantastic, with a kitchenette and living room. The elevators were old and confusing (only one went to the garage, but you could not call just that one and there were no stairs).Breakfast was average-- the scrambled eggs were really dry and so were the waffles/french toast.Some of the staff were kind and helpful, but many didn't seem to care and others seemed new. Maybe this location had a high influx of new front desk members at the time of my stay. There are two kiosks at the front desk, and a phone between. While I was checking in, the other kiosk was also occupied by a staff member assisting a customer, and another staff member was using the phone between to talk loudly to a service member about a customer who had not had their room cleaned in three days. This was concerning, distracting, and off-putting. This also distracted the lady helping me check in from doing her job.One night, we were awoken by a very loud banging noise coming from the room next to us close to midnight. The banging, accompanied by yelling, continued for several minutes. Worried and scared, I called the front desk, but the person who answered didn't seem to care about the situation and at first didn't offer a solution until I asked if there was nothing they could do, and they said they would send somebody up there again. The front desk staff member said the lady had been locked out by her partner who had deadbolted the door. By this point, the lady had been standing outside her room yelling and banging on the door for half an hour (by her account-- overheard when she yelled at her partner when he finally opened the door). I'm worried that the staff allowed this to continue for so long. What if the partner had been suffering a medical emergency, or had never opened the door Nobody followed up with us regarding this issue, which was disappointing. Had someone touched base in the morning and apologized for the inconvenience, I likely wouldn't be writing this review.Upon checkout, the front desk staff threw away a handwritten not eaddressed to me as a guest of the company whose conference I was attending because my partner was performing the checkout. Overall, I was really let down by my stay here. The rooms are so nice and the location is great. I thought the Hyatt brand could be trusted with providing a great, seamless customer experience, but it didn't seem like they cared.Hello and thank you for taking the time to share your experiences at our hotel with us. First, I offer my sincere apologies for the poor care shown to you by my team. We are in the process of training several new additions to our staff but this does not excuse the lack of professionalism and lack of interest in resolving your concerns promptly and with care. Please know that I have addressed your concerns with my team so that we can continue to improve our quality of care. If I can be of any additional assistance, please contact me directly.",2018

Front Desk and Dining room staffs were very Friendly. We arrived on time to check in so that we have more time to see Seattle. But, our room was not ready. We waited for couple of hours in the lobby before it became available. What Not very impressive!Then the whole night our wifi wasnt working. They said they will reset the router as soon the Technician arrives but it was already too late. We had to check out early for our City Tour and our cruise Housekeeping I think they have to pay more attention in terms of their room services. Towels and toiletries supplies were not enough to accommodate 5 people. We had to request some more supplies.

I was traveling in business and it was smack bang in the middle of centre city with easy access to everything. There was a TV in the room with loads of channels to keep you occupied. The shower and toilet were very clean. The only thing I'd say is for the shampoo and shower gel provided to be fragranced..that's just my preference.The staff were get polite esp Walter and Troy..thanks boys for making my stay welcoming..it was great to chat with you guys and sorry I didn't get to say goodbye properly. I can't comment on breakfast or food as I didn't have this and I don't drink so cannot comment on the bar.Lastly the vibe was really nice and Noamaan, Now that's a headline! We are shooting for 7 stars but there are rules about what defines star or diamond level. Those ratings are related to amenities instead of service. That's why we love TripAdvisor!

Talk about paying attention to detail. What a great customer experience. Hi Sarah, FIVE BUBBLES!!! We love it, thank you!! Glad you got some time to chill in our Backyard, it's the perfect place to hang after a day of work.

Hope to get back soon, there's still plenty of summer left to play! Evan",2018
5.0,"The staff and hotel were very nice. The rooms were modern and obviously recently redone (at least our 13th floor room was.) The building itself is old, but it looks good inside. The lobby and bar are clean and modern. There is a pool table and lots of games to entertain kids and the young at heart in the lobby area.Downtown Philly is heavily populated with the homeless. The Methodist Church across Arch St from the Aloft Downtown seems like a focal point for them. Several times I was approached for a handout, but never felt like my wife, son and I were in any danger. I wouldn't necessarily recommend walking alone after dark in the area, but it is a bustling area during the day. We walked back as a group to the hotel from City Hall subway station after a Phillies game (maybe 11:30pm) and it was fine.It is very easy to get to a bus or subway train in a 5-10 minute walk. The views of City Hall are stunning and Love Park, the Reading Terminal Market, even Independence Hall and the Museum of Art are all walkable. The Convention Center is right next to the Aloft, so it would be a good place to stay if you were attending a conference there.There were always Uber and Lyft drivers a minute or 2 away when we needed to get anywhere. There are also cabs and the hotel offers Valet parking for 50 or so a night. There are also several parking ramps and some street parking in the area as well.There is a McDonalds across the street, but no restaurant in the building. There is a small store for food and drinks inside the lobby and a 7-11 convenience store a block away down the street on Broad St. Otherwise, I didn't find a ton of food options immediately around the hotel, but there are a lot of options a couple blocks away.It is certainly not cheap, but I liked the hotel and I would stay there again the next time I go back to Philadelphia.Hi JW, Thank you for the FIVE BUBBLE review! We get excited when our guests connect with our hotel and city as you did. Your last line I would stay there again is what we all work hard to accomplish. We also appreciate your taking the time to provide other travelers your experience outside the hotel. Our pride extends beyond our hotel and into our community. It's great that you're sharing personal and authentic stories, thank you for that. I hope all your travels bring you much joy!Evan",2018
5.0,"It was my first time staying with aloft but now it has become my top choices. The location was great and accessible to trolleys and within walking distance to many spots. The room was well decorated with many chargers. Front desk was really helpful and friendly. The only problem is the terrible sound insulation that I could hear my next door clearly. Many leisures in hotel but I was too busy to explore. Definitely coming back for my next stay in Philly.Hi Jane, We are thrilled you're coming back to Philly and of course our hotel!!! The FIVE BUBBLE review is much appreciated!!! Everyone needs to stay powered up. Thanks for noticing how we placed USB ports all over the hotel!! Bedside in two locations, on the desk, under the W XYZ Bar and throughout the lobby areas. We want to be sure your connected and in touch!Can't wait to have you back! Thank you for your business!Evan",2018
5.0,"Everything was great, staff is wonderful, Misha at front desk was so helpful! So glad I picked this hotel to celebrate my husbands birthday. Loved our room-was a corner room with 2 queens, very comfortable. Favorite part was the lobby, just a great place to hang out, nice bar, fun games, music at night, really cool area. We will be back!Mich, MISHA is amazing! We are glad you chose our hotel for the B-Day celebration and that we took good care of you. Of course you don't have to wait for his birthday to come back, we can help write a new Rx if needed: Phillies, Bell, Parkway, Casino, Shopping, Kimmel Center, Concerts, Theater, just to name a few :) See you soon! Evan (Misha's biggest fan)",2018
5.0,"My other half and I always enjoy Aloft hotels wherever we go for the modern decor, pet friendliness, and good value. Downtown Philadelphia is no exception. The location is absolutely perfect. You walk right outside and are staring at City Hall on Broad Street. If it wasnt so stinking cold it would have been an ideal location for walkability. Rooms were as expected for Aloft, and value was great as usual. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to return when it isnt so cold outside. Hi Micah, 5 STARS! Wow, thank you! Glad you enjoyed our hotel and of course the perfect location. The weather gods were a little off in their timing for your visit. We are looking at record highs this week, want to come back We've got some space available!Looking forward to your enjoying our backyard on the next visit. Sending warm thoughts...Evan",2018

5.0,Paul the other bartenders are always so attentive. I enjoy going in and relaxing. I tell everyone I know to stop in and see how nice the Saint is. The food is good and the drink menu is fun... I tell all my friends to stop in 417 to 714 happy hour.It's a great happy hour to try all that we have to offer in food and drinks. Thank you for taking the time to write a review and we look forward to seeing you soon!,2018
5.0,The Wait staff in Bar not so good and not friendly. The rest of was stay was very good. Clean rooms great location for the Duval Crawl. I will be back next time I'm in the area. Being I am a fan of Key west I wanted to try something differentThank you for your feedback and I will share this with the Food Beverage manager so that this is a single occurance. We hope to have another chance to serve you on your next trip to Key West!,2018
4.0,"First off I'll start with The Saint is an unique boutique hotel that sits on Eaton Street with access to Duval Street. We had booked what they call the petite double I believe and they aren't wrong. My husband paced it out and we figured it was approx 150 square feet. That being said it did have everything you needed and was tastefully done, but you'd never want to stay in it more then a night or two. They had a lovely balcony over looking Duval Street that sadly for us was 1 room away from ours and on NY's Eve they had their party on it . I wish I would have known this in advance as laying in bed after midnight it felt and sounded as if I was still in the middle of the dance floor. That aside I suppose I should have expected that being NY's but I've never been in a hotel especially a Marriott where the party was more important to the guest comfort. They have a lovely bar in the lobby away from the guest rooms which would have been a better and less noisy option for the quests who weren't attending their NYs party. All and all I'd say there are plenty of other choices to stay at in Key West at comparable costs (this wasn't cheap at 448.00 per night for 2 for the smallest room) that would cater more to the comfort of their guests then the 50 dollars a person they made at the NY's party.I apologize for the noise on New Year's Eve. Key West is a hot spot for the holiday and our hotel is known for the balcony countdown party overlooking Duval Street. The rates are comparable to other hotels for that night yet may have not been quieter on this busy day on the island. We hope you will give us another visit on a non-holiday and reserve one of our larger Superior King rooms that will be more comfortable for you. Happy New Year to you and your family.",2018
5.0,"I got a 'thank you for staying with us' email with the above words in it. On my last trip I had just left the Suncoast and was talking to a slot attendent at the Mirage who also likes the Suncoast. He asked why I liked it so much and I said I did not know - now I know - I feel so comfortable here. I stay at the Suncoast for 2-3days every 2months as part of a longer10-11 day holiday. It is not the Strip but it is still a nice casino - a locals casino with bowling, a cinema and bingo hall. But it also has a conference centre / banuet hall. You do not look out over the Strip but you can look out over a golf course and their nice pool area. When I stay on the Strip I actually ask for a Mountain View room - rather than a view of McDonalds and Walgreens! Even though I am a semi regular I am treated as a local. If I room charge I do not need to show ID - that's OK - we know you. The Cocktail waitresses even remember what I like to drink. They like my English accent! I had changed the dates of mt stay and the receptionist spotted that my dining credit had not been carried over so she corrected that. They now have sofas for the rest of your party can rest while you sign-in. The area is smoke-free - for those not used to casinos but I still say I do not recognise the casino as being smokey. I like the buffet for breakfast (8.50 inc tax) but then Du-Pars for Dinner where I can sit and have the food brought to me. The wine is 5 a glass 4-7pm - a nice end to the day. I'm interested in trying PengZu. The menu is on the Suncoast website and has some interesting dishes that attract this 61yo white guy. For burgers etc they have The Game sportsbar or the bowling alley snack bar - I have enjoyed both. Some days I do not feel hungary but I am tired so I get a Subway and a bottle of wine from the Gift shop (Glen Ellen Cabenet 4) and retire to my room. There is a refrigerator in the room. Du-Pars do the room service but the menu was missing from my room the last two trips. At some hotels that would be an issue but not at the Suncoast. My next trip will be in May with a suite at NYNY, a room at the Suncoast and a suite at the Mirage. I have asked for a Tuscany suite on eStandby. If I do not get it I will be happy with my 550sqft Suncoast room with floor to ceiling windows. I can get a bus from outside NYNY (or the airport) to the Suncoast for 2 - the Westcliffe Express (WAX). The bus can take me back to the Strip and somedays it has taken me to Downtown to visit the Suncoast's sister properties.Awesome! We love to see five-star experiences. We are glad our mission is fulfill through you experience with us! Thank you for visiting us! See you again, next time!",2018
4.0,"Everyone was very friendly and our room was nice and clean. My room had yellow sinks and toilet and a phone in the bathroom just like the 70's and 80's Vegas. Would definitelygo back. The only drawback was the breakfast buffet. Although it was given to us free for the first night the food was lousy. Du Pars was a much better choice.Thank you for your review! We appreciate it. If you have any advice on how we can earn that last star, then please let us know, because our goal is to provide you with five-star service.",2018
5.0,"My wife and I live in Vancouver, BC, Canada. We regularly vacation in Las Vegas because of the climate. We discovered the Suncoast several years ago and stay there frequently. The casino offers tons of entertainment, has bowling, several movies theatres, great restaurants and is surrounded by awesome golf courses. The Suncoast is located in Summerlin which is the best neighbourhood in Las Vegas. Needless to say, we love it. We will absolutely be back.Thank you for visiting us! We look forward to you visiting again.",2018
3.0,"The hotel was clean and we had at our request a quiet room, room service was good.

5.0,We stayed the weekend at the River Hotel and could not have been happier. The staff at the front desk was amazing. They provided us with coupons for a free appetizer or dessert at Lou Malnatis. They also provided some great recommendations for breakfast. The room was great. It was a little small but all Chicago rooms are small. It was clean and had a great view of the river and the Trump building across the river. The bed was comfortable. The location was close to all the downtown attractions with a big bus double decker bu stop right across the street.,2018
1.0,"So this hotel is pretty nice to look at, and the staff was very friendly, however, we entered the room (very small) and continued to look at the room. We lifted up the sheets and it was clean and mattress was clean, however in the box spring of the bed, there was a swarm of bed bugs that once we flashed the light on them they all dove into the box spring. We continued and the front desk and they upgraded our room, however due to our disgust we arranged a booking at the Hyatt Regency down the road which was beyond clean. Thank you Front desk for your efforts to accommodate, but we could not deal with the bed bugs in your hotel.Guest feedback is important to us and we take any comment regarding bedbugs seriously. We have a proactive pest elimination policy that includes regularly scheduled inspections by a professional pest control company. Additionally we have thoroughly trained all of our housekeeping associates to inspect our guest rooms for any signs of pest activity. If necessary, our pest control company conducts bed bug elimination procedures using the latest in pesticide technology.I encourage anyone with questions or comments regarding our pest control policy to contact me directly at 312.777.0805 .

5.0,We brought our 6 year old granddaughter to Chicago with us. We have stayed at this hotel at least 6 times and have never been disappointed. The location is perfect for walking to many touristy spots. We even walked to and from union station. Thank you for staying with us recently and for your kind recommendation both are greatly appreciated! We are pleased to hear that you are a great fan of the River Hotel and delighted that your granddaughter had a wonderful stay. We agree -- our prime location in the heart of the city is perfect for experiencing all that Chicago has to offer.We look forward to welcome you back to the River Hotel very soon!,2018
2.0,"The building looks beautiful the lobby too. They upgraded me to a room with 2 bedrooms, 3 tvs and 2 baths! I was ecstatic at first. But more things wrong than I've ever encountered in 1 hotel room: 1. The a/c, even when set to 65, was warmish, and only blowed in the entryway, not in the bed area.2. The light next to the bed was linked to the entry light: if you wanted the bed light to work, you had to have that hall light on. If you turned that off, the bed light went off too.3. No ironing board!4. Nothing to put the soap on, just the bathroom counter. That's icky.5. The bedspread was cool looking, but not something I'd like to sit on or sleep under. But if I peeled that away there was just the sheet. 6. That entryway was dark, even with its one light turned on.7. The counter with the coffee machine was dark too, even with the light turned on.8. Get rid of coffee dispensed in those plastic cup thingies - so bad for the environment!I lost count after that, but you get the idea. All these things could be tweaked and it would be a good place.",2018
5.0,"Loved this hotel for its service, amenities, location (walking distance to everything), free wine hour, laundry room, the rooms were very clean, perfect size, comfortable bed. I would definitely stay here on my next visit.",2018
4.0,"So if you are going to Chicago to stay in your luxury hotel to be pampered with massages and 5 star room service- this is not your hotel. If you are going to Chicago to shop, sight see, or hit a few wonderful restaurants and want a clean, well maintained hotel where you can sleep peacefully- this is your place. The price is great for what you get. There are few frills, but the accommodations are very reasonable in terms of function and comfort. The perks:- Great location! Close to shopping, parks, restaurants, Navy Pier and most downtown sights.- In and out valet parking for a reasonable Chicago price (52/day). You can find cheaper parking nearby, but not with in and out options.- Complimentary ater bottles and purified water on all floors.-Lounge with complimentary snacks, coffee, tea, and soda open for much of the day.- Wine in the Lobby in the evening.- Responsive, kind staff.-Free high speed internet is high speed enough for most purposes.The less fabulous aspects:-Rooms are small or sparsely decorated. The rooms serve as a clean, functional space. There are no bathtubs, only showers. You get a a couch, TV, mini fridge and desk if you upgrade to a queen suite.-Matrresses are firm...not so firm those of us who prefer softer beds can not sleep, but firm.- Valet was understaffed for our visit with only one attendant even during busier times. It did take 20 minutes to get our car when requested.- The cable is not top quality and goes out or the stream gets paused often.",2018
5.0,"My experience in this hotel was perfect! Rooms are clean, well-appointed, not so big but privided of all comforts (Tv, coffee machine, bathroom, and free wifi). In each floor, near the lift, you can find a free water dispenser with new bottles and also some chocolates and candys. Every day at 5.00pm, in the lobby is arranged a complementary wine free for the hotel hosts. The hotel is very well mainteined and clean but the strenght point is the position in the city. It is located in the loop (the city center) on the river in front of the Trump tower. It is really close to millenium park and magnificent mile (two of the most touristics place in the city). Moreover the hotel is close (5-7minutes by walk) to the underground line for the O'Hare airport. The staff of the hotel is extremly avaible and ready to meet all you needs. I was in chicago for a business travel so i can't give you informations about costs because i didn't manage the booking of the hotel. Anyway, after my experience, absolutly, I would suggest this hotel for a pleasant and comfortable stay in chicago.Dear Concetta D,Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for taking the time to provide a detailed review of your experience.

1.0,"Adrianna was ghetto. Jay was trying to be professional in his t-shirt and jeans, even trying to correct my English. I've stayed at this property several times and was pleasantly satisfied. I simply needed a place to sleep, wash, and change for conferences that keep me out of the room more than in. Unfortunately, this session was horrible. I'm currently on the line with customer service seeking resolution. Again, before this stay I've never had these concerns. (Side note: the rate was higher than I've ever paid this time. I would think they customer service would match). Jay told a lie to the customer service agent and said he gave me time to make arrangements. He said he could lie because I lied on his front desk agent I simply shared how she acted.Mu, Thank you for sharing your concerns.

3.0,Its an older hotel and the room was darker and smaller than expected. The breakfast provided was very nice and they made upgrades to the bathroom. Overall basic and okay place to stay just no visual thrills or excitement. Located directly across from the airport so it is super convenient for air travel.,2018
3.0,"Im not sure if Ill be other reviewers are used to sleeping in tents, because I dont understand why it would be so great about this place. It has a feeling of age about it, like it was built 30 years ago and trying to look modern but failing.While Ive stayed in the worse hotel rooms, theres certainly nothing distinctive for attractive about this place. Frankly, my wife and I were thinking that we wouldve been better off just trying to sleep at the airport terminal then spend the night here.Thank you for taking the time to provide us feedback about your stay! I am sorry that you were not impressed with our facilities. We just had our exterior renovated in April 2018 and we look forward to getting an interior refresh soon.

2.3,"Bad: At the arrival, we paid the parking fee in cash (43) and the rest of the amount for two nights stay with a credit card. Checking the transactions during the last couple of days we realized that the parking fee has been charged on the credit card TOO. We asked for an explanation and have not received any answer at all. It's simply unacceptable. The room furniture is old, need a renovation. The space around all windows - both in the room and the shower - and the windows themselves were very dirty. Basically no choice for breakfast - consisted of two types of cereal, boiled eggs, white and whole grain bread. Good: Coffee machine available at all the time free.",2018

Then, they sent the cleaning staff to 'open my door for me' only to discover that the electronic key system won't work if the batteries in the lock haven't been replaced. Lastly, I never could figure out how to make the steam shower work, but after the episode with the door I decided it wasn't worth asking. Good: The night shift desk was helpful and once she realized she'd made a mistake, she went about solving the problem as quickly as she could. I was still locked out of my room for 30 to 45 minutes.",2018

3.35,Bad: Best days of this hotel are far behind and the interior would need a major upgrade. When you enter the Room you first notice a bad smell due to combination of moisture and lack of proper ventilation. The air condition was extreamely noisy.

5.0,"Clean comfortable hotel. Dennis the shuttle driver provided a tour into Newport and back to the hotel that was better than paid tours in Boston and Manhattan we have been on. He was the highlight of our trip. We are frequent visitors to Newport but never knew the history. We learned the different neighborhoods and restaurant choices other than harbor side. Breakfast on his recommendation was great! The free breakfast at Hampton is not why we stay there. The cleanliness and security is the most important feature to us. Someone needs to recognize Dennis for his efforts!! We will be back because of this A1 service.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at our hotel with the TripAdvisor community. We appreciate your kind words and compliments regarding the cleanliness, comfort and security of our location.

Lisa and Jean welcomed me and additional family members and ensured that we were well informed regarding shopping opportunities close by. We were availed of their free shuttle services within a 3 mile radius throughout our stay. Friends and family were all there to attend my daughter's wedding just a few miles away, their individual attention to each party member made my stay at Salt River especially exceptional.

The only downside was (upon checking out) the early morning shuttle driver was running a little late, and due to the amount of people and luggage, was stressed and became rude when trying to squeeze the last few people on the shuttle......however the shuttle driver the day before was very friendly and helpful so it all evened itself out.",2018

Sheridan was very accommodating, a tad expensive, but stayed because other family members were there. Very clean. Doesn't have curb appeal, but the inside looks up to date and modern. Went to the hotel bar for a drink and some apps - Sauvignon Blanc didn't taste like sauvignon blanc, cheese platter had more meats than cheese, meatballs were rubbery, waitress was very nice. Breakfast at the same place was great. Easy check out. Good: Booked through booking.com and my reservation wasn't sent to the Sheridan, so when I got there, they had no record of my stay.

4.6,Bad: Did not like the breakfast.,2018
4.6,Bad: Bed wasn't awful but could have been better. Parking is a couple blocks away in a garage (I would consider this neutral - pretty much standard for Miami Beach). Good: Quaint with an art deco feel. I will definitely be back!,2018
3.15,"Bad: The unesessary complaints regarding noise level which included laughter in the court yard as not above he constant noise level of the street. Good: Unfortunately, the occupants are a mixture of residents and vacationers. Not a good mix for individuals wanting to enjoy their vacation as residents will complain if you are too loud.",2018
3.35,"Bad: There is nothing on website or booking.com about the rules, and there are many, at this hotel, or that it is a quiet hotel. There is nothing about quiet hours starting at 11 on the sites either. Nothing about the limit to number of people that can visit you in your room. Nothing about the fact that when people come to see you they will be detained at the gate and not allowed to enter if you have more than 4 extra people you are visiting with in your room or the outside courtyard area. If these are the rules then fine, but we would NOT have stayed here if we had known this .Please put this information on both sites so that others do not have the same experience we did. A woman in the office was very rude and threatened to call the police for no reason. She was extremely rude and disrespectful and threatening during our stay. There are ways to communicate respectfully and calmly and this was not the case. I would never ever ever tell anyone to stay at this hotel. In fact, I will tell everyone I know to avoid going to this hotel unless they want to be treated rudely. I am sure that this woman in the office will respond saying she was not rude or threatening, but take my word, I do not ever write reviews and this is exactly what occurred and it made the stay unpleasant and uncomfortable and impossible to make plans to go out with friends. Ridiculous.",2018

5.0,"I had a wonderful stay at this hotel. From the time I arrived the customer service I received has been nothing less of truly amazing. All the way from the staff that checked me in to the staff at the bar during happy hour. The shuttles are great if you dont have a car they will take you to/from the airport, to/from the mall and anywhere requested within a mile radius of the airport. The room its self can use a bathroom update but overall not too bad. The breakfast was great with cooked to order omelets. This hotel was worth every penny.",2018

1.0,"This was the WORST hotel experience I have ever experienced in my 47 years walking the face of this Earth. The hotel room was egregiously small, the beds were sunken in the middle, the pillow cases, linens, bed spreads and blankets were all filthy, the room had the stench of heavy cigarette smoke, the front desk LIED to me about not having any other rooms available and, to top it off, they still charged my credit card for a two-night stay despite me not even staying 15 minutes. I told the front desk that I was not staying and found somewhere else to stay and they told me that I would not give a refund despite the horrible and horrific conditions mentioned above. Lousy customer service. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone except the police. And, I would only recommend it to the police in order for them to arrest and file charges against hotel staff for theft -- for charging my credit card when I did not even stay at the hotel.",2018
5.0,Location is perfect. We have stayed 5 to 6 times and always had a nice stay. Room is always clean. It is quiet and clean hallways. The staff does a good job of keeping the lobby and breakfast area very clean.,2018
