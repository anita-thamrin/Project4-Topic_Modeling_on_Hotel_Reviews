4.0,"My sister came into town so we decided to go to The National Harbor for a night. Checking in, the hotel staff was very pleasant. Parking is in a garage behind the hotel, for 18. Our room was clean with nice views. The bed was very comfortable. We were able to walk comfortably to the harbor and sightsee. There are also restaurants and bars within walking distance. Breakfast was great, with canadian bacon and sausage patty meat options. There was also a waffle station, eggs, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, muffins, and other pastries. Checkout was a breeze, and the front desk staff again, was very pleasant. I very much enjoyed my stay and I will definitely return!",2017
4.8,"Bad: The bed wasn't that comfy, which was surprising given all of the other amazing details. Sheets were rough/stiff- not cozy. Could be easily fixed, though!. Good: This was by far one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. Check-in and check-out was super fast, staff was phenomenal, and the room was very intuitively set-up with thoughtful details technology. It was clear that Virgin isn't just a typical hotel. The chamber set-up of the room allowed for privacy comfort, even in a relatively small space. Snacks mini-bar had 7-11 prices. Everything was super clean, well serviced and wonderful. In short: STAY HERE!",2017
4.6,"Bad: Noisy in lower floors, but not at all at higher ones. Good: Very comfy beds, great lobby/bathroom",2017
4.6,Good: Staff went out of their way after checkout to locate an item I had left in the room. The room had already been cleaned and the staff got the item back to me as quickly as possible. Roof top bar was beautiful.,2017
4.8,"Bad: A little bit of noise from the 'L' down below, but then again that is part of the character of the city. Good: Overall cleanliness, new feel, friendly efficient staff, great happy hour! Excellent location.",2017
5.0,Good: A fun place to stay with great staff and lots going on in and around the hotel.,2017
5.0,"Bad: A little sticker shock with 65/night valet parking, but I hadn't done my research for cheaper options, so not a big deal. Good: Super hip and definitely a young techy vibe, but everyone was friendly and helpful. Room was as described and very spacious for the location and price. Even though it is right at the corner of the L Tracks, sound wasn't a problem. Exactly what was needed!",2017

4.8,Bad: Room servicing late in the day. Good: Great hotel. Friendly staff.,2017
2.5,Bad: The restaurant was closed for a refurb and as a result we had to eat our breakfast in the lobby on our knees. We had tiny plastic plates and plastic cutlery and a poor food choice . I was not informed by booking.com that this was the case . It was not the service we wanted for 675 dollars for 2 nights!!. Good: The room was good,2017
3.95,"Bad: the room was not very big and a couple more hooks here and there would have been nice to hang coat, towels etc. Good: nice decoration, well located",2017
2.1,Bad: Thumping music all night long. So loud the windows vibrated.,2017
1.65,"Bad: The room I booked was a non-smoking but when we got to the hotel, the gentleman at the counter said they didn't have any and have not had any available for several days. The guy then said that in order for me to get my money back, I'd have to go through the third party that I booked the room through. Good: Nothing",2017
3.95,Good: HELPFUL STAFF,2017
5.0,Bad: I still really hate the cigarette smoke in the casino. But other then that (and all the crazies on the fremont experience at night) its fun and awesome!. Good: Location was perfect for our leisure trip. Free valet parking is always amazing (of course we tipped every time we picked up and dropped off our car!) The amount of things to do on the Fremont Experience is endless! What an awesome experience. Truly the 9th island for Hawaiians like us! We love it!,2017
2.5,"Bad: 1st - PARKING LOT **BAD,BAD,BAD** This is 2017, nobody need driver to parking car, unless you're 85 yrs old (should not even drive). But drivers that steals quarters from your rental car, this is very low. 2nd - They asked a deposit of 100. Because I was planning to get it back, I used a BC and not a CC. On check out I was informed that it will take 1 to 2 days. Should I trust on it 3rd - If you sleep on that room 512 and need a AC on, make sure you are deaf or use to leave near NY freeway. The noise of that machine it's worst than sleep on LV international airport at 9am with your windows car open. Will I stay on this hotel again NEVER. Good: Location, access to shopping, and cleanning",2017
2.9,"Bad: Dirty and old room. Valet parking is not comfortable. Casino is old and has no roulette. If you have a car, you can stay, cause the price is everything. Good: Pretty cheap for Las Vegas",2017
4.15,Bad: Check out was too slow. Good: Buffet was excellent,2017
4.6,"Bad: To be honest, nothing to complain about. Just too bad that there wasn't any free wifi in the rooms. Good: Considering that we only paid 88 dollars for 2 persons for 2 nights, this was great value for money. The hotel is located in the middle of Fremont Street, so you just step outside and you are in the middle of the action. Our room was on the 9th floor and we didn't hear any noise whatsoever. The room was maybe a bit old fashioned, but still offered everything you need. We were positively surprised that we had access to the pool and gym of the California hotel. We just needed to walk 2 mins to access their facilities. The gym was really good equipped for a hotel gym. Pool was really nice and quiet. Would definitely stay here again!",2017
1.65,Bad: This room is straight out of a horror film. Good: I like Fremont st,2017
5.0,"Bad: nothing!. Good: buffet is excellant! room are clean, great view of mountains and saw fireworks in distance.",2017
5.0,Bad: Very satisfied.,2017
2.9,"Bad: The parking garage is so hard to find. I passed it at least two times trying to find it. You also can't self park, which is a hassle coming back from being out and about. You have to rush to gather all of your belongings, souvenirs, etc, because the entry bay to the garage will hold two cars at most. You can't dilly dally. Hope that makes sense. Only paid WiFi,which was a big bummer. The express snack bar/grill staff were very unfriendly. Every time I went to the buffet, the line to be seated was always sooo long. I never did end up eating there for that reason. Good: Near all of the Fremont Street Experience stuff.",2017
2.5,"Bad: The cleanliness wasn't the best. One of our towels and bed sheets had red stains on them which the staff informed us was rust, and not blood....upon arrival the toilet wouldn't flush as well. We got stuck in a smoking room even though we didn't book a smoking room. The noise was unbearable, and when combined with the smoke just added up to disaster. Good: Close to the public transportation systems. In the middle of downtown Las Vegas.",2017

2.9,"Bad: The beds were not too comfortable. Good: I really liked its location, and slot machines, the Paradise Buffet, and Duncan Donuts place within the Fremont Hotel.",2017
5.0,"Bad: The elevator to the parkade requires some maintenance - at least a wet mop to kill whatever is lurking on the floor!. Good: This resort hotel is amazing - the location in perfect, the rooms are huge, and absolutely spotless!",2017
2.7,Bad: It was hard to get into the parking area because of traffic (an event was going on) no coffee pot in the room. I like to sit and drink coffee for and hour or so before doing anything for the day. I'm not paying 3.00 per cup of coffee. Other than that it was ok. Good: It was a beautiful hotal,2017
2.1,"Bad: Rooms small, air conditioning don't work!!.",2017
4.15,"Bad: Old, not many outlets. Good: Location and price.",2017
4.8,"Bad: Main Street Station recently implemented paid parking (I stayed last week and it was still free). Although parking is free for hotel guests, they have not worked the kinks out of the system. We almost missed our flight due to being unable to leave the lot. Security had to be called and that person told us that there have been a large number of similar episodes. They need to FIX this!. Good: Everything EXCEPT the parking.",2017
1.65,Bad: none.,2017

5.0,Bad: The pool was not at the hotel had to go to another hotel to swim and that is not stated when your booking your room. Just make it clear that there is not a pool at the hotel other than that loved the hotel!. Good: Great place to stay,2017

3.95,Bad: There were a couple younger staff at the desk during mid day times that seemed bothered by questions. Good: Easy to park. The room was clean and cool. Valet staff was really nice. Steve the maintence man was amazing. I dropped my pearl earring down the bathroom sink. He took the time to take the loop of the drain and get my pearl earring back. I was grateful for his extra service and care.,2017
4.15,Bad: Waitress didn't come around a lot even with tipping. The hotel was older and had some cosmetic problems. Good: Lots to around the property and decent food prices. The buffet was really good.,2017
1.45,Bad: Rude staff. Cleaniness. Bed. Had to change rooms three times. I will never stay there again!. Good: Nothing,2017

5.0,Bad: We liked everything. Good: The beds were comfortable the rooms were clean,2017
4.6,Bad: One of the things we did not like was the fact that we couldn't wake up to a cup of coffee in the morning without paying an arm and a leg for one. The other was that they should at least offer free coffee and beverages to their customers. Washington State casino have a coffee and soda machines for their customers to enjoy as they play. I also do not like the idea of casinos shoving resorts fees down a person throat when they know that the percentage of customers do not use the resorts. Good: I enjoyed the friendly staff.,2017
4.8,Bad: The bed was too soft for my mate and we need more pillows. They were happy to provide the additional pillows. Good: The entire staff was very nice. The room was clean and we stayed on the north-side and did not hear any noise from Fremont Street.,2017

5.0,Bad: Had some trouble regulating the water temperature in the shower. Good: The use of space was excellent and the room and the bed very comfortable.,2017
3.15,Bad: The breakfast was minimal. The rooms were tiny. There wasn't a workout room. Good: The room location was at the back of the hotel and quiet.,2017
4.4,"Bad: Rooms were pretty small, definitely not suited for a family but great for a couple. Good: Great location, Comfortable rooms, breakfast was good (beagles, cream cheese, donuts and coffee.)",2017
3.35,"Bad: Very expensive hotel relative to services eg Breakfast is repetitive and very weighted to carbohydrates. No skimmed milk, only half and half. Lounge area a little jaded, perhaps Remember to add in the tax etc as this significantly adds to the cost of the hotel. Good: The location is central to a range of must-see sights",2017
3.95,Bad: Room is on the small side. I was on one of the back rooms. There are no views and other buildings can see inside your room since windows are high. Breakfast is not attended and no hot option. Very narrow corridors. Good: The decor of the room is very modern and pleasing with sound equipment for those that want to listen to music with speakers on the wall. Floor of shower is non-slippery. Decor of the bathroom is also very nice. Location is outstanding with Copley subway station accross the street as well as bus stop. Restuarants and shops in Newbury Street one block away. Bagels and donuts in breakfast were fresh.,2017
5.0,Bad: parking. Good: BREAKFAST AND THE BAR WERE REAL NICE........BARTENDER chris ..great guy,2017
2.3,"Bad: staff r not helpful at all, room was really soooooo tiny even I booked large room, but the staff gave me two options,, if I want the large room I booked,,,, I have to go up a stair with my luggages, then down a stair again with my luggage to the basement, then walk through a hall way to reach my large room,,, or get a tiny one so I can use the elevator and make it easier for me to reach a room with all my luggages. really Bad experience,, I paid 200 a day for this SH,, I would Pay only 160 at Bellagio LAS VEGAS and get the best service in stars hotel,,,better than this hotel charlesMark. dont book this hotel Pals in case u have other options. Good: location",2017
5.0,Strange drainage smell when entering the reception area Loved the location and friendly staff,2017
3.35,Bad: Walls are very thin - we could hear upstairs and next door neighbors. The breakfast was very basic. Good: The location was great. Easy access to T. Nice bathroom.,2017

3.75,"Bad: The room/bed were a little small and the room was quite gloomy, very little natural light and the lighting wasn't great.

5.0,I liked the breakfeast like swedish buffet,2017
5.0,Good: I liked the breakfeast like swedish buffet,2017
3.95,"Bad: Provided breakfast is just bagels and doughnuts + tea/coffee. I'm not sure how that qualifies as continental! Beds are very small but OK for a relatively small couple - would be uncomfortable if you are much over 6 feet. Rooms are small but that's the only way you are getting a room at this price in this location. Good: Location is excellent (we walked everywhere including from Boston Back Bay station to the hotel with our bags - it's a 10min walk), staff were friendly, rooms are small but reasonably well appointed, hotel and rooms were very clean.",2017
4.15,Bad: Closest parking was a 4-5 minute walk away for 28 overnight. Closer parking is available for 48 overnight. Good: Great neighborhood on Boylston and a block from Newbury St. Plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance to choose from. It is one of the better values compared to other hotels in Boston. Half a block from the Copley T station if you want to get to another part of the city. 15- 20 minute walk to Fenway Park for the Sox game.,2017
2.7,Bad: Room and bed were tiny - not even a queen bed. Bed took up most of the room. Breakfast was coffee and a bunch of cold bagels. Bathroom was also tiny. Not worth the exhorbitant price at all. Good: Location was good.,2017
4.6,Good: Bathroom was large and the speakers in the wall,2017
3.95,Bad: I didn't like the siE of the rooms cozy but to small. Good: I liked the comfort of a small room the location and the staff that was working there,2017
4.6,"Bad: Too pricy, very basic for what you pay for. Good: Nice staff, good continental breakfast included. Excellent location.",2017
4.6,Bad: Room too small. Late check in at 15:00. Good: Excellent location and the staff was super polite. WiFi was working good. Check out at 12:00 was very convenient for me. Storage area provided.close by the center with all lot of coffees and bars around.,2017
5.0,Good: The wifi connection in my room was loose and disconnected during the Inauguration weekend. But the nightclerk (red-haired Irish lass) tried very hard to fix it for me. In the morning William 3 came in and tried to fix it.,2017
4.8,"Bad: Super slow wifi, Comcast kept getting stuck and I would have to wait about 45 seconds just for the channel to change - wish there's was at least oatmeal for breakfast. Good: Location - room - clean - right in front of public library of Boston",2017
3.75,Too expensive for what offered Location and staff,2017

4.6,"Bad: Breakfast was a little sparse but was as advertised. Good: Nice room, small but cozy.",2017
4.6,Good: Excellent location,2017
5.0,"Bad: Breakfast a bit simple, but plenty of places to eat in the local area. Also, the safe in our room didn't seem to work, but it wasn't a big deal. Good: Excellent location, with Copley T (metro) station within a few minutes walk, and a range of restaurants and bars along Boylston Street. The Back Bay area also has a few great sights to see, like the old Trinity Church and Boston public library, which are almost within spitting distance of the hotel. If you're here during the Boston Marathon (mid April), the hotel is almost literally on the finishing line, which could be very useful or very inconvenient, depending on whether you're a runner or not!",2017
5.0,"Good: The room was lovely and spacious, bed very comfy. Staff changed our bed every day and fresh towels. We could not have been better looked after by manager Lewis. Events organizers Ricardo and John were great help for tours.",2017

4.4,Good: Very friendly staff. Rental of a beach chair and umbrella was included in the room price.,2017
3.15,"Bad: Small rooms for American standards. Could have been cleaner. Towels were dirty. Average standard hotel, not as good as expected. Good: Very good location, one block from the beach (2 min walk). 3 min to Ocean Drive/Lummus Park, 5 min to Nikki Beach Club. Chairs and umbrellas on the beach from an external provider from 8.30 am to 6.30 pm included. Towels are provided. Valet parking 35 for 24h, no overnight street parking (day 4/h).",2017
4.6,Bad: THE BATHROOM WAS ON THE SMALL SIDE...PROBLEMS CONTINUALLY WITH THE TV / CABLE RECEPTION...HAD TO CHANGE ROOMS ON MY 3RD NIGHT BECAAUSE THE AC WENT OUT...VERY ANNOYED ABOUT THAT..BUT...OH WELL...,2017
4.4,Bad: room 222 is directly below the fitness center and it gets very loud when someone is on the treadmill. Good: Devon at the front desk was a phenomenal host! He went above and beyond to make our stay great!,2017
5.0,"Good: Room was lovely, shower was great, staff were friendly and very helpful. Bed was comfortable and the room was really quiet",2017
4.4,"Bad: The house is built in another age - access to rooms and room size are not large - but OK. The rooms are not well insulated reg. noise. The other guests behaved very nicely - good clientele - but when the garbage truck etc. is working out back, you will know it! Bring your earplugs and you'll be fine. Good: Staff was very helpful, courteous and professionel in a good way. Front desk staff responded quickly to my requests (WiFi code renewal, instruction in how to make calls from phone in room, air-con etc). I ran into the sales manager as well - I think the new owners are putting a pretty good team together, who all know that customer satisfaction is king!",2017
1.25,Bad: I stayed at this hotel for 2 days..they asked me to pay 100 deposit even though I did not know that I had to spit this money before booking the room I finally agreed and in good faith and i paid I was told that the money will be returned back to my account within 7 working daysand so it was done for 1 month and the money I did not get back.,2017
3.55,"Bad: The facility is normal and so many people held parties at night, so you may not wanna stay there if you are seeking a place where is relaxing and quiet. Good: Staffs are friendly and the location is good",2017
4.8,Good: Clean and nice room with comfortable bed. Really friendly staff. This hotel is my favourite in Miami Beach.,2017
3.75,Bad: Was told I would get a robe and didn't.,2017
4.6,Bad: Spa wasn't available. Good: Staff are exceptional and very friendly,2017
5.0,"Bad: Car was freshly washed before we arrived to valet the car. 3 days later, the car was filled with hard water marks from the sprinklers and now we need to get the car detailed to remove the spots. A bit frustrating to not get the car back in the same condition... Good: Location great, staff was pleasant, buffet was good and the chef that made the omelet was amazing",2017
4.4,"Bad: I didn't like that check-in 'begins' at 4pm. You check in and wait for them to call you when your room is ready. Ours was ready at 6p. This was more of a plain hotel, not like a 'Vegas' hotel. Food, entertainment, and 'gambling' were limited. This is the best spot to be AWAY from Vegas while IN Vegas...if that's what you're looking for. Good: All amenities were top of the line.",2017
4.6,"Bad: Nothing!. Good: 1.Great location, although 1 block back from the strip it is very central and perhaps better than staying on the strip to the far left or right. 2. Value for money for the size and comfort of the room 3. Short walk from hotel room to lobby entry unlike most mega hotels in Vegas 4. Small bar/casino across the road with 1 beer... unheard of on the strip",2017
3.35,Bad: I was overcharged at the property and after two requests to front desks no one got back to me. The third time I went to follow up myself. They overcharged me 130 dollars for the room. The hotel was under renovation so it was not good being on a partial construction site with the sound of drills going off. I would advise to shop around on the strip. Good: Bed was comfortable,2017
1.65,Bad: Pre-paid for a premium room with two double beds but was given a disability access room with a king bed. .,2017
4.15,Bad: View from room over car park. Good: Great location just off the main strip near Caesars Palace. Room comfortable and staff helpful. Allowed us to have a late check out at no extra cost.,2017
2.1,"Bad: The first room - AC not working. No hot water in bathroom. The second room - was not totally cleaned. Leftover shampoo, conditioner, and soap were found in tub area. AC is noisy.",2017
5.0,"Good: Didnt smell like smoke, and no gambling",2017
2.9,"Bad: They cannot find my booking ticket when I arrived, and the girl who serve us went to have joke with others, let us wait for her for a long time. Mini bar is empty.",2017
4.4,Bad: No pool. The Breakfast room was not appealing. The buffet was limited. Good: The heavenly beds,2017
4.8,"Bad: The elevator was tricky to use as you had to insert your room key which didn't always work. The front desk never mentioned it either so I had to figure it out on my own. Good: The location was great. The room was basic but still nice and clean. The pool was low key, perfect for relaxing.",2017
2.1,Bad: No my experience was horrible it was a bad experience frome the moment we arrived to the moment we left. I had 6 rooms reserved 2 were canceled by hotel then when we asked questions the manager decides to to rais his voice at us to the point everyone on line to check in and around tje aria was able to here what was going on. My guest were unhappy they traveled from sacramento to vegas a 9 hour drive to vet bad service. Then vale was horrible my sisters car was broken into while on possession of vale instead of helping they yelled at her and dint help her. Ontop of that all my guest and I were separated and it was hard to meet up in my room they elevaters only alow access to your floor not others. Good: .

4.8,Good: Great stay for short stay.,2017
5.0,"Bad: At breakfast the waiter gave you a receipt stating that although the breakfast was free (included in the price of B B) it was worth 49.98, ie they were after a tip. I felt this was unnecessary and made guests feel uncomfortable. The breakfast was self service, the waiters just brought tea and coffee. Good: This hotel was lovely, very clean, good breakfast and friendly staff. Good situation,about 5 minutes walk to The Strip.",2017
3.75,Bad: The toilet in our room blocked couple times. Good: Great location and free parking! Less than 5 mins walk to the strip.,2017

5.0,Good: I loved everything,2017
4.15,Bad: Check-in process as staff was deceptive and misleading as to when we could check-in. Others around us were equally upset with the dishonesty. Good: Great price through Booking.com. Room was clean and bed comfortable.,2017
3.15,"Bad: Our toilet overflowed at 1am and the water wouldn't stop. When we tried to call reception the phone didn't work. My husband went down to reception whilst I packed our clothes as I naturally assumed we would be given another room. He returned with a maintenance employee and a housekeeping employee. They refused to give us another room (so we could go back to sleep!) instead keeping us awake until 2am whilst they sorted out the problem, extracted the water from the floor (the bathroom was flooded), mopped the floor and brought fresh towels. Good: The reception staff were very friendly. A bottle of sparkling was sent to our room to celebrate our wedding anniversary upon our arrival. That was a really nice touch.",2017
5.0,Good: The bed was like sleeping on a cloud! The location is away from the congestion of the strip but easily accessible. The Westin will be my first and only option when staying in Vegas.,2017
5.0,"Bad: Toothpaste. I wish more hotels came with toothpaste in the bathroom . I hate calling to get some. It's a necessity. That's my only complaint, but that's pretty much for every hotel I've stayed in. Good: The bed was beyond comfortable, didn't want to get up at all",2017
4.8,Bad: quiet off the strip but close enough to walk. Good: beds were very comfortable,2017
3.75,Bad: Nothing. Good: Quieter compared to the strip hotels,2017
2.7,Bad: Hotel was under a major renovation n there is no casino n no restaurants within the hotel. Ice machine was broken on our floor. You have to have key access to get ice from other floors but no access ever given. We had to ask 6 times for keys! They wouldn't work at all! Very very inconvenient! Apparently from what the staff said they have key problems all the time n i saw lots of guest going through the same problems. Staff is also rude in a professional way. Good: Beds we're comfy,2017
2.9,"Bad: Buffet Break fast was not to the standard of Westin. Small casino Worst of all away from Strip, which was not described well by booking.com when booking hotel......... Only one small restaurant. Good: Staff was very courteous.",2017
4.6,"Good: I'd go again. So relaxing. Aside from BALLEYS, it was a longer than desired walk to other attractions.",2017
4.8,Bad: No casino.,2017
5.0,Bad: .. Good: Five minute walk to The Strip - Belligio. Monorail station across the street at Bally's. Car hire agency in hotel.,2017
4.4,"Bad: Vacant block and vagrancy around hotel. Good: Proximity to the strip, yet quiet and friendly",2017
2.9,"Bad: The staff were not professional. The reception staff who helped me checking in was dressed like being at home. She looked very tired and communicated with me without any expression on her face. My bathroom was a disaster. It became a swimming pool after I used it each time. BTW, the real swimming pool was closed for the seasonal reason. Good: The staff were helpful. The bed is comfortable. The location is just in the very center of the main tourism avenue.",2017
3.55,Bad: Had to wait in line for 45 minutes to check in not enough staff to help. Room was not ready for an hour after check in.,2017
1.9,Good: Staff was rude to me and didn't recognize my platinum status,2017
4.6,"Bad: nil. Good: Good place if you don't want to be directly on the strip. Large rooms, clean and renovate, which is not always the case in Las Vegas. Perfect breakfast and very gooid service.",2017
4.4,Good: The staff were courteous and our view from our room was stunning. Highly recommend,2017

4.15,"Bad: Neighborhood. Good: Comfortable, great service.",2017
2.9,"Bad: The pool area was really disappointing. Very small and the service wasn't great. The bathroom in the room needed an upgrade. Needed a re-grouting in the shower, the sink had a huge crack in it and the sink made this weird gurgling noise when anyone above or below us turned on a tap. Good: The bed was comfortable.",2017
3.35,"Bad: Food, buffet was good but limited variety. Good: Convenient location and free parking",2017
4.8,Bad: Non smoking hotel but people were smoking in casino and staff didn't talk to them. Good: Loved the bed linens...very comfy.,2017

3.55,Bad: Ice maker broke on our floor. Water in lobby not always kept filled. Wasn't always cups available for water. Good: Water in lobby.,2017
1.45,"Bad: The eatery was very expensive, not many choices, it was freezing cold in the hallways, it was noisy, the toilet leaked, and when it wasn't leaking it was running. Called for maintenance but no one came. Tub was dirty. Not impressed at all.",2017
4.6,Bad: Kept hearing a dog crying in the night when I tried to sleep. Good: Room was accommodated well Staff was friendly and the manager I spoke with whom helped us was very helpful n patient,2017
3.75,"Bad: Walls are very thin, be prepared to hear your neighbors.",2017
4.4,"Bad: The continental breakfast options vould have had more choices. Along with some breakfast items being available for the 11pm -6am.

3.75,"Bad: More activities at the hotel. No gift shop, no casino. Good: The bed was comfy.",2017
5.0,"Bad: Although this hotel was a pet friendly hotel, guests are not allowed to leave their pets in the room unattended. If I needed to step out quickly, I would have to make other arragements for my pet. I seek out hotels that are strictly pet friendly because I know that a little barking isnt going to be an issue. Good: Cleanliness of the hotel, the polite and helpful staff.",2017
4.4,Bad: The actual pricing of the hotel was different from when i booked it . Good: The starbucks and how there was a gym and pool .,2017
5.0,Good: Convenient and clean,2017

4.6,Bad: No casino. Good: All of it,2017
3.95,Bad: Hotel facilities starting to look dated. Good: Was priced well for the days we booked (including weekend). Staff was welcoming.,2017

3.95,Bad: The food is too simple. Good: Very quite,2017
5.0,Good: Only a block off the strip. Luxurious feeling room. Excellent value!,2017
2.7,"Bad: I will write in English so the staff can read if they wish: we arrived exactly at 4 PM (declared check in time), the room was not ready, the reason being 20 people having done an early check in, please notice that check out time is 11 AM (so they clearly have a workforce planning problem)! An extremely unfriendly staff representative told us that we had to wait, asked me to give her my phone number so that I can receive a text message when the room would be ready, meanwhile we were granted a pass for the pool (which was no extra given that the pool was available for all hotel guests as we were). I asked according to your experience, how long will it take 20 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours her answer was rude and dismissive I don't know, the only thing I can tell you is to wait for the text message. At that time your room will be available!. So we went to the pool (definitely small and overcrowded), no seats available, very noisy. We waited, and waited and waited and waited... 2 hours and 20 minutes, then I went back to the lobby extremely upset, I started complaining and magically the room was ready... By the way: the text message never arrived. Good: Free parking (is this something to be appreciated)",2017

3.75,Good: Central location. Nice cafe and a Starbucks on the premises. Easy check in. Very helpful concierge.,2017
4.6,Bad: The pool was to small. Good: The spa was amazing,2017
3.35,"Bad: The hotel is very outdated. Old rooms (we were moved because of an old airco that made a lot of noise), old elevators, tiny beds that should not be sold as double unless you like sleeping on top of each other, mediocre breakfast with very little healthy options (mind you, a 7 extra charge for a cappuccino is outrageous). Very basic pool area. All in all we would give this hotel a good 3 stars. Not more. Good: Location is ok.",2017
5.0,Good: Top of the line..great,2017
5.0,Bad: Not a fan of cigarette smoke. But I guess you can't do anything about it in the gambling area. Silly to charge a resort fee on top of the room charge. Just charge what you need for the room. Good: Very helpful and friendly staff from check in to the valets.,2017
5.0,Bad: Gym was closed. Only notification on website was the spa closure. Good: Great + accommodating staff,2017
4.6,Bad: The only issue I had was there not being a microwave/refrigerator in the room. Good: Room was clean. It wasn't as crowded as the other well known hotel casinos. The staff was friendly and helpful.,2017
5.0,Good: Westin has always the most comfortable beds,2017
5.0,Good: I loved the fact that staff was very understandable and after a very tough night (shooting and evacuation of the whole Strip) let us stay complimentary till 4pm. This was really exceptional service and hospitality. Thank you!,2017
4.6,Bad: The coffee for the in room coffee maker was awful....couldn't drink it. Sooooo bitter and strong !. Good: The bed was extra comfy. View from the room great (overlooked the High Roller) and the room was very clean and housekeeping great.,2017
4.8,"Bad: Expensive breakfast. Good: Clean room, comfortable bed, good location (near but not in the Strip) and calm",2017

5.0,Good: We were very pleased with everything.,2017
5.0,Bad: The smell sometimes from sewer only when in hallway. Good: The hotel was great and staff was very friendly. We will definitely stay there again,2017
3.35,"Bad: There is no longer a casino on the hotel grounds which is unfortunate. Also, the pool is a bit small. You have to battle to find a spot with the lounge chairs at times. Good: The rooms were clean and staff was nice. The parking is free and it is about 1 1/2 blocks from the strip. It is on the north side of the Bally's.",2017
4.4,Bad: Even though we asked to have the room cleaned they only folded the towels..had to ask for clean cups and coffee!. Good: No smoking hotel...love the beds!,2017
4.25,Bad: The lobby is not adequate. You have both Check in and ways out at the same place. Good: Very good value for money and location,2017
4.8,"Bad: check-in line was slow. Good: Parking was very convenient, partly because we drove a hybrid and they had special spaces reserved for hybrids.",2017
1.45,"Bad: No customer service and they try to bill you for everything, for everything. Good: I wish customer service would reply to my emails. I should be getting a refund, but Booking has never replied to my emails. I guess this was my first time and last time using Booking.com. Worst stay ever.",2017
4.4,Bad: No hot water in the morning. Good: This was a great hotel on the strip. The only downside was bo hot water in the morning. But they acknowledged they had an issue. Would be nice if they could offer a partial refund for this.,2017

4.4,Bad: Fit and finish construction of rooms could have been better. Good: n/a,2017
3.75,Bad: I was under the impression there was a casino... there is no casino.,2017
3.75,Good: Comfortable Bed !,2017
5.0,Good: This hotel it's the most amazing I have ever stay everything of this hotel it's just awesome,2017
3.95,"Bad: rooms were in need of updating especially the bathrooms. Toilet was leaky and loud, the TV was dated, and there were updates being performed at the time of stay. Other than than it was worth the money. Good: The proximity was great because it was easy to access and close enough to the strip. They have a great sandwich shop at the shell station on the corner open until 2 am which is a bonus and saved us a ton of on food. Also a little hole in the wall casino bar where you can get a beer and all beef hot dog for 3, shots for 4 just down the street.",2017
2.7,"Bad: We parked our car in the hotel parking and the second day we realized that somebody had broken in. Somehow we didn't find Las Vegas a safe place to travel. Solely for leisure, I will not return to US again. Not value for money. Good: It was one of the cheapest places we found in Las Vegas during those days.",2017
5.0,Bad: Room was a little tight. Good: Comfortable beds: adequate bathing supplies,2017
2.7,"Bad: The fact that the Casino was being renovated and not in use, and that we weren't notified about this prior to arrival. An extra tax being applied to our charges. To call this establishment a resort is simply untrue. No laundry facilities available. No exhaust fan in bathroom. A limit as to how cool the air-con could be set. Good: The size and set-up of our room was very good. The location in regards to the stripwas approx 500 metres away.",2017
4.8,Good: The hotel was great I loved the room the bed was super clean and comfortable and so was the bathroom. We only stayed one night here because our other hotel was booked for the rest of the trip but I will definitely be staying here the next time I come to Vegas for my entire trip. Great location,2017
2.9,Bad: There is spa in the name of the hotel and the spa service wasn't available! What a rip-off!. Good: The room was nice with a good view,2017

5.0,"Bad: No microwave in room. Good: Bed extremely comfortable professional staff, extra clean. Great place. Also liked the 24-hour Starbucks.",2017
4.4,"Bad: There is no longer a casino, and the pool is seasonal despite it easily being warm enough to be used. The sauna was also out of action. With the lack of these attractions it becomes a very plain hotel. Good: Staff throughout the hotel are excellent, especially at the bar on the late night shift and on reception. Very friendly people. Hotel well presented, clean and comfortable. Location is great, a short walk to bellagio, Paris etc for those who want to be near the strip but not on it all the time!",2017
4.8,Bad: I liked everything besides the price. Good: The cleanliness,2017
2.3,Bad: Advertising there is a casino but their isn't this should be updated so that customers are aware prior to booking. Also our room had an old moldy non working refrigerator. Good: Staff was nice,2017
2.5,Bad: Rude Staff.,2017
5.0,Bad: Nice hotel in LV close to everything. Good: Everyyhing,2017
3.75,Bad: Wasn't on the strip. Good: Showers and location,2017
2.3,Bad: When we arrived we were met by a unfriendly doorman and it was so loud due to the bar that we could barely hear the person at reception. Each day the room was made up apparently but barely even folded the sheets. towels weren't folded etc. We have stayed in lots of hotels over the years and had recently stayed at the Loews Boston which was a far far better experience with far friendlier staff. Good: Food was awesome.,2017
5.0,"Bad: The parking rates are outrageous (59 USD/day for valet), but this is for all of Boston, not just this hotel. . Good: Great location, very convenient for Boston Commons, subway and good restos. Hotel was very nicely appointed with great products. Wish we had time to use Bliss Spa!",2017
4.8,"Bad: They don't have complementary internet in the room. Good: Love the location, the room was big and very comfortable, love everything about it!",2017
5.0,Bad: The hotel cannot control the metal plate in the road that bangs when cars drive over it all night. Good: The bed was very comfortable and the berries and fresh fruit were awesome! The staff was friendly and more than made up for a mishap with the room reservation.,2017
4.6,Bad: Double beds a little small for 2 people. . Good: Comfortable gym and great gym.,2017
5.0,"Bad: Our room was missed one night to clean (we didn't care about the bed, but we needed some supplies). It's OK, not a big deal. Good: Great location to visit Boston. Room was spacious and modern. Overall staff was professional and friendly.",2017
5.0,"Bad: We only had one robe in our room and no slippers, but we weren't bothered enough to ask for these from the front desk. Good: We loved our stay at the W Boston! The room was a great size and the bed huge and comfortable. The staff was so accommodating taking delivery of two packages for me and bringing them up to the room. I didn't use the Bliss spa on site, but it is an amazing spa so I will definitely visit next time!",2017
3.75,Bad: We were initially given a room close to the gym on same floor - made it very noisy early in the morning so no chance of a lie in. We asked and hotel obliged with a room change to different floor. Good: Bed was comfortable,2017
4.8,Bad: There is nothing I didn't like. The room was great and service was excellent. Good: Service at check in was fantastic and the service at the bar in the lobby was outstanding. We enjoyed our stay. Perfect location and we will return,2017
3.45,"Bad: Arrived at reception late evening - it was in the middle of a very busy bar, couldn't hear receptionist. Got in lift and hadn't been told we needed to swipe room key card to get anywhere! Also had to pay per day for wifi!. Good: Beautiful room, good location",2017
5.0,Good: Very nice room and quite big. Nice ambience and cool bar plus helpful staff.,2017
5.0,Bad: I wish breakfast was included in the price. Good: Everything!! Especially the fitness center.,2017

3.35,"Bad: The staff was snide and grumpy. Good: The large bathroom, the silly decor",2017
4.6,Good: I loved the lighting and how comfortable the bed was.,2017
2.7,"Bad: Ridiculously noisy, external alarms, cars honking horns through the night and the thumping music till early hours made sleep tricky ! Not a hotel if you like a little peace in the evening. Good: The property location was perfect",2017
4.8,"Good: Great location,comfortable beds,very clean",2017
5.0,they were able to accommodate us with a feather free room. the door men were especially friendly and remembered us!,2017
4.6,Late night club crowd was a little loud around 2am when the clubs are closing down,2017
3.75,"Bad: There was an anti-noise device plugged into each of two sockets to compensate for the fact they are in a noisy road. In fact, this emits itself a loud roaring sound. When unplugged, things were fine. The road noise was not bad at all (we were on the 12th floor). One of the senior staff kindly refunded a breakfast bill given this and another issue (cordless phone by the bed wouldn't stop beeping through the night). The restaurant and room service were extremely expensive. There was a slight sense too that some of the decor (wood-appearance veneer on cabinets, shower curtain not panel ) was a bit cheap and scuffed given the price. Good: Staff were great - thoughtful, friendly and clearly dedicated to running it well.Decor and atmosphere of front lounge area welcoming and stylish. Location is very good.",2017
5.0,Big room,2017
3.95,"Bad: How crowded the lobby seemed, mostly with locals having a stance putting out a I'll kick your ass before I move aura. Good: The overall atmosphere was clean and modern, easy to navigate to facilities I needed over stay.",2017
5.0,Bad: The only draw back is the noise at night from th people coming in and out of the lounge and adjacent nightclub. Though it didn't bother us personally. Good: I loved how central the location was. The hotel is in the theatre district. We walked to the harbour as well as Shopping and all the parks around us. After a long day of walking around we enjoyed A massage at the Bliss spa. We also enjoyed having a drink at the lounge before going to bed. It was a great experience for us. It might be too noisy for people who want peace and quite. I also had the best sleep in those beds. I would recommend staying at the W Boston.,2017
4.4,Bad: When I booked my room it said that that parking was included in the price I paid. But when we got there that wasn't the case!.,2017
4.8,Bad: price. Good: everything,2017
4.8,Bad: A/C in the room didn't work at first but was fixed. Good: Great experience,2017
3.75,"Good: very expensive, Wi-Fi as an extra cost is ridiculous given room charge",2017
3.75,I waited way too long at the front desk to check-in and out,2017
5.0,"I love the St Regis (generally speaking but especially the New York). I've stayed here 12 times over the last 4 years or so. It just seems to get better each time. Tire's a great new feature which is the Rooms control Manager (Molly) emailing me ahead of time to see when we would be arriving. My SPG upgrade available when we arrived at about 1015AM which is rare these days. Then there is the front desk staff - they are all wonderful but I want to call out Shelomie and Hugo who know Ryne and I by name and immediately make us feel at home. How about that concierge desk - again all are great but today I'll call out Krista and McKinley. I emailed while on the plane about getting in to the Salon for Mani and a shave. Our appointments were made and ready for when we arrived. Our Butler this trip was Marianna. She is awesome and gave us the utmost service during our stay. Finally Kevin and Juan our In Room dining attendants - just as perfect as can be. I named names because this is what this place is about. Consistent and friendly staff that makes The St Regis our home away form home. We really love it.Dear Kenneth,Thank you so much for taking the time to not only share your feedback regarding your most recent visit, but also to be so detailed and generous with your comments about our team members. Molly, Shelomie, Hugo, Krista, McKinley, Marianna, Kevin, and Juan are indeed amongst our most stellar performers and we could not be happier to learn that they made your and Ryne's visit enjoyable and memorable. Rest assured that they will receive the well-deserved recognition.Please come back soon! We want to be your home away from home many more times to come!Happy New Year!!!Daniela on behalf of All Your SRNY Friends",2017
1.0,"On my most recent work trip to NYC, I chose to stay at the St Regis vs my usual (The Peninsula). Never again will I go back. After a long day of client meetings, I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar (King Cole Bar). I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service. I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew I'd need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day. Literally within 15 seconds of powering on my laptop, one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a No Laptop Policy after 4pm. Seriously I had to ask myself, was I really staying at a 5-star business property I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal. He looked annoyed but then retreated.Fast forward 15-20 minutes...my food and wine arrives and I'm not even halfway through. That's when the FB manager then approaches me. He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive. Again, to set the context, I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting. I am not engaging with anyone yet I'm being disruptive One would think an FB manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you don't go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop. When I told him I didn't understand their policy and why he was enforcing it, he said I was not fitting in to the bar scene. Unbelievable. He then tells me he'd be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work. I am at this point just dumbfounded. It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter. Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel. And just to be clear, on the many occasions I've had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done, not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave. Crystal clear for me now...Dear sfellelle, On behalf of the Management team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for your visit. We appreciate you taking the time to detail your recent stay at our property.Our hotel prides itself on providing five star service, yet in some cases, mistakes can occur. We apologize for the experience that you encountered in our Food and Beverage department, and please know that this is certainly not our standard. Rest assured, we took the necessary measures to do an internal follow up with our staff to ensure that all our guests have a flawless experience in our bar in the future in similar circumstances.We most certainly hope you will give us another opportunity to service you again in the future. Please don't hesitate to contact me directly to book your next visit or to discuss in length your experience at: Octavia.margineanstregis.com. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",2017
5.0,"Of course it is very beautiful, and from its look you might think that it would be stuffy, but it is not- Very friendly and welcoming staff, and the Head Butler, Nestor, on the 7th floor could not have been a better representative in making us feel at home! Best Hotel in NYC- have stayed in many , luxury and not,in NYC and all over the world. Actually always wanted to stay at the St. Regis, and this did not disappoint!Dear Diane,We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoyed your stay, and that Nestor made you feel at home. Our Signature Butler service differentiates us from the competition, and we are thrilled that you were able to experience this first hand.We look forward to welcoming you back to New York again soon.Kindest Regards,Senih Geray",2017
3.0,"I stayed in a huge two-room suite here, and I just don't understand the appeal. Perhaps my tastes are just not, ahem, refined enough, but I found the hotel to be a bit stuffy and uninspiring. This was the 3rd or 4th St. Regis that I've stayed at, and I finally realized that the brand just isn't for me. I guess I prefer more modern or unique hotels. It wasn't a bad experience, and the separate living room would be helpful for entertaining a certain type of client, but I wouldn't stay here alone and I wouldn't stay here for a romantic trip.The service was spectacular in the suite, and included a private butler. That said, I don't really need a private butler when I stay in a hotel. The front desk workers were friendly if not downright charming. The hotel lobby is small and, for my tastes, uninteresting. It lacks the wow factor. The concierge was very good, but seemed to sigh when he realized I had such pedestrian questions such as what new broadway shows might be worth seeing (I've been to NYC more than 30 times, but I always ask the basics).For the money, I'd pick the Waldorf Astoria or the Gramercy Park hotel for its warm, sumptuous colors and textures (in the larger rooms) or even the Mandarin Oriental.Note - I stayed in this hotel in 2014.Dear Allen,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your stay with us.We are sorry to learn that the style of our historical property did not meet your preferences, but are glad to read that you enjoyed our team's service. As far as our Concierge is concerned, rest assured I will personally follow-up and use your feedback as a re-training opportunity.When Mr. John Jacob Astor and his wife Caroline built the hotel in 1904, on purpose, they wanted to have a very small lobby to make the arrival experience of their friends and family members as intimate and as home-like as possible. While we treasure and value the heritage of our hotel, we do realize that the lobby size might not be of a wow factor and we apologize if you were disappointed.Hopefully you will visit us again and give us more opportunities to be at your service.Have a wonderful start of the new year!!Sincerely,DanielaOn behalf of The St. Regis New York Team",2017
3.0,"This was my second stay at the St Regis NY. The hotel has been revamped is much more expensive bit i can't say it has much improved. On the bright side: got an upgrade and a very nice room, late checkout, the concierges are knowledgeable and get you in difficult places like the Polo Bar across the street.downsides: the Ducasse restaurant is gone and hasn't been replaced so you're left with a somewhat lame breakfast/diner lounge. The King Cole must be run trotskyists since i was refused entry before midnight despite identifying myself as an hotel guest. I duly complained and next day was served a deliberate over spicy bloody mary in what felt like retaliation. The hotel as a butler service that packs your stuff on demand. I lost i cherished Lanvin fedora on the process without so much of an excuse. Considering the price you pay you can find better options in NY. By the way i'm an SPG Gold so the upgrades and late check outs come with the status.Dear Joao C, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York. We are deeply sorry that we were not able to meet your expectations during your recent visit to our hotel, all of which attributed to your negative feedback.Please allow us the opportunity of discussing your comments further so that we can examine the issues which you have noted. I may be reached at Octavia.margineanstregis.com, and we would then be able to arrange a time at your convenience to speak.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",2017
5.0,"I loved this hotel. It captures a distinctive golden age vibe in a very special way. On check-in, there was a small disturbance in the lobby due to the behaviour of another guest who was unhappy with her allocated room. The only blip during our stay was that the room we were allocated with an external view was clearly given to this complaining guest. The manager literally took the key from the hands of the lady checking us in as she was giving them to me (and after we had been told what a lovely room we had been allocated)... But the hotel was professional enough to deal with our concern immediately, and we were given a gorgeous external view room facing onto Fifth Avenue and complimentary breakfast and drinks. This rapid commitment to service was indicative of the rest of our stay. Otherwise, the whole stay was perfect. The room was elegant. It felt very classic and luxurious, but also had any modern convenience. The King Cole bar was the perfect place to meet friends. The complimentary Bentley was a special touch to drop us to dinner at a perfect concierge recommendation. We loved the atmosphere in the hotel restaurant the next morning for breakfast. I would stay here again without hesitation. We felt valued and special.Dear johntillett, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",2017
5.0,"This was our second stay at the St. Regis, and this time we booked through American Express Platinum concierge. As part of their fine hotel's program, we booked for 2 days and the third night was comped. It also included 100.00 towards meals and complete breakfast for 2. Upon checking in, Hugo acknowledged me as a Platinum SPG guest and upgraded us to the Madison Suite! Every room comes with a butler, who will bring you complimentary tea or coffee service. There's a house Bentley which is available on a first come,first served basis. The food is extremely good in their restaurant and the King Cole bar is internationally famous.Dear 112traveler47, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

4.0,"Nice spacious rooms, good location . The only thing bad about it is that they don't have buffet breakfast and it takes lot of time to get a table and it becomes quite expensive too. 2 of the mornings, I was offered high chairs of bar for breakfast which is not ideal when you pay about 60 dollars for simple omlette, juice and black coffee. But overall very good.Dear neeraj821,Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at The St. Regis New York, and thank you for your comments regarding breakfast. We will share your feedback with our team for review, and appreciate your thoughts. We hope to see you again soon.Kindly,Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",2017
3.0,"Stayed here to catch NYC at Christmas and were excited to stay in a legendary hotel. We have stayed at the St. Regis in Mexico City, Singapore and others, and were expecting the same level of excellence. We truly wanted to love this hotel, but instead, left feeling grateful we used points, and not cash, for our stay. Sad to say, we would not return. The good and the bad - The Good - Rooms are beautifully appointed, location can't be beat and some of the staff were outstanding. The Bad - Attention to detail has been lost. Some examples - long lines to check in and out. Yes, we realize it was high season, but staffing should be commensurate with the expected flow of guests. Next, after the bellhop delivered our bags, we asked for a bucket of ice. It never arrived and we had to get it ourselves. Breakfast took even longer than the ice. Small, but telling, details. Left feeling like the St. Regis NYC relies on its reputation to pull in the crowds, its service certainly doesn't warrant a pricey stay. Dear NOIDK, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York. We are deeply sorry that we were not able to meet your expectations during your recent visit to our hotel, all of which attributed to your negative feedback.Please allow us the opportunity of discussing your comments further so that we can examine the issues which you have noted.

5.0,Bad: Had a very frustrating time booking online. The website was not secure. Good: Clean. Very important!,2017
5.0,"Bad: I understand it is a japanese hotel but the American breakfast was terrible. I appreciate that they had all options, but the eggs weren't well cooked, the bacon wasn't cooked and for that it was expensive. there is no room service and for the hour i had to be at my conference it was hard to get out extra early to find a diner nearby. some didn't open in time. It was a buffet so super fast... I also don't eat alot of the other things they offered like the toast etc... and they had a full spread of what i assume would appeal to foreign visitors which i think is also great and nice for them. Good: it was very conveniently located to my conference across the street... Not the most luxurious hotel but certainly perfectly fine for me to attend conference across the street. The double tree down the road much more beautiful, but also much for expensive... I would stay here again as long as i could find a decent breakfast nearby. Staff very pleasant.",2017

It's close to Michigan Avenue/ Water Tower Mall and Navy Pier.,2017
4.15,"Bad: Breakfast was not included and in my opinion too expensive, especially for guests of your hotel. They told us it was a buffet and 15 per person. We didn't even check it out at that point. Good: Location was within walking distance of the Magnificent Mile. Price was reasonable for the location.",2017

3.35,The bed was not comfortable. The shower was nice,2017
4.6,Bad: The bed/mattress was not as firm as I like. Good: The hotel staff was incredibly attentive and sent us a bottle or Prosseco and chocolate covered strawberries to help celebrate our anniversary. It was such a welcome surprise that really made our stay special. We also appreciated the drink tokens and lounge area with appetizers- made it very comfortable to stay there!,2017
2.7,"Bathroom is dated. Bath tub had rust build up. Room service failed to provide timely service and when the food arrived for 2 people, was only given silverware for 1. The evening reception provides 4 complimentary cocktails.",2017

4.15,"I paid extra for a city view and what I got was a disappointing, ugly building right across the street. The extra money spent on having a city view was not worth it. It seemed clean. Nice room.",2017
4.4,Bad: The breakfast was just some muffins and warm coffee. I guess there is no restaurant in the hotel. Good: The staff was great. The room was comfortable. The rates were very reasonable.,2017
4.6,"Bad: That I couldn't stay longer. Good: The complimemtary continental breakfast on the rooftop was a very nice touch! Good coffee, too!",2017
3.95,"Bad: Floors need to be vacuumed much better. Finding old snack food and candy is not what I would expect. It wasn't horrible, but noticeable. On 2 separate occasions we had hotel staff come into our room. First time was shortly after we arrived. Housekeeping was confused on which room she was to clean. No big deal. 2nd time was on Monday morning, about 9:30-10AM, someone opened our door without knocking, noticed we were in there and left. By the time I could get up and get to the door, look out, they were gone. This was VERY odd and concerning. Good: Location was fantastic. Front desk staff were outstanding.",2017

5.0,Good: Everything was great Excellent lake cation,2017
4.6,"Bad: Nothing to dislike at all!. Good: As a first time visitor to Chicago, the hotel was an excellent central location from which to explore. Firstly, the property, services, cleanliness, wifi and staff were very good. As mentioned by other users, there is a continental buffet served on a credenza on each floor outside the elevators from around 6.30 am. Some may want a more sumptuous offering, but this is a very generous continental breakfast and would be more than sufficient for most. Travelling to the hotel from O'Hare was simple. If you can read and follow English signs, it's an easy and cheap transition on the Blue Line public train into town. The hotel website gives precise information on which stop to disembark and the 5-10 minute walk to the property. Probably a better option to use taxis, Uber etc if you are travelling with lots of luggage or you have mobility issues. As for food and entertainment, the hotel is surrounded by excellent options. Restaurants and bars of all types abound. The House of Blues is right across the road for example. River Walk is also a highlight and is only a 3 minute walk away. The hotel area is well serviced by public transport and taxis, plus the first stop of Hop On/Hop Off Bus tour company is 5 minutes away in front of the Trump Building. As in other cities and countries that offer this service, it's an excellent way to get a quick feel for a new place, and Chicago is a stunning place to visit. By the way, Buddy Guy's Legends Bar is well worth a visit. People will always have various expectations, but I found the staff, service, amenities, and most of all the music on the night, to be fabulous as a musician and huge blues fan, this was a big tick on my personal bucket list. The H.O.B was also great, but didn't have time to get down to Rosa's Bar or Kingston Mines. I'll leave that for the next time............................but will be staying at the Kinzie.",2017
4.6,"Good: Great location, clean and friendly staff.",2017

3.55,"Bad: The hotel has no real public areas, and there's a facilities fee which I didn't realize. The reception staff weren't that helpful. The room wasn't quiet enough for a really good night's sleep due to loud aircon and some other random noise that persisted even with aircon off.

5.0,"Bad: Nada. Good: Amenities, staff, decor, room",2017
3.95,Bad: The area around the hotel is a bit rough with the tenderloin being so close the streets around the hotel are not the nicest. You really have to get an uber or use public transport to get somewhere for a nice walk in the evening. The one positive on the location is that you are near to a transport hub so easy to get away from the area. Good: Hotel facilities were great. Breakfast at the restaurant was good and the bar served nice cocktails. Lots of games are bonus when waiting for people or something to do before bed. The hotel rooms are comfortable and spacious.,2017

4.0,"Well, the grounds are well kept. pool was clean, and this was our third stay. Beds are ok, and the rooms served their purpose. Large tiled floors with some recycled furnishings from a popular strip hotel. It really wasnt a bad room. cheaper here for a week than 1 night on the strip. Bonus.. 8 feet to your room.. vs 1/2 mile on the strip!!! Not bad att all for a refirbished 1950's hotel, not too bad at all.

5.0,My 93 year old mother and caregiver were evacuated due to the fires. This Best Western made every accommodation to make them welcome and comfortable.

The staff were excellent and provided us with a lot of local information and recommendations for our specific requests. They provided us with a lot of options for our stay and were so friendly and informative. We would recommend this hotel purely on the standard of the reception staff.Dear 185robynp,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. I'm so pleased you enjoyed our stay and our staff was able to help you with your plans around the valley. We hope to see you again soon. Cheers, Genafer",2017

4.0,"Great location for us with family. There is a really nice exercise room, laundry, pool and business office. Coffee and tea are in the room with a fridge. The staff are friendly. The rooms are clean and comfortable with a prepared breakfast which I prefer rather than the carb load at some Best Westerns.",2017
5.0,"This was a nice Best Western. We were allowed to check in early. The free breakfast was the best of any hotel I have ever visited because we could choose items of the Denny's menu. There was ample parking with shopping and dining across the streetdavidsI8109CM - Thank you for the 5 Star review. It makes us so happy to that our guests have such a pleasant stay with us. We hope to see you again soon! - Cheers, Genafer",2017
2.0,"The room was so noisy we could hear every footstep from the people above, every toilet flush and every shower that they took. Winetasting in the courtyard was very loud and folks stayed after the winetasting drinking until the wee hours of the night . Staff was not willing to quiet them nor even leave the front desk to talk to them. Breakfast items in the morning were not replenished hot water was out replaced with warm water not useful at all . Rumors of free vouchers to Dennys never appeared .This was not a cheap property I do not feel I got my moneys worth I couldve stayed at a motel eight or six for equivalent valueOn behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.",2017

The location was really good for getting around the city.Doesn't get much better than that! Thank you for your kind words and we look forward to your next visit, Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",2017
5.0,"We always enjoy staying at Aloft locations. They are unique, clean, and our teenagers love them! The hotel staff are always helpful and friendly. The downside is that you have to walk a bit to get to the tourist areas, but it is located downtown.Thanks so much for your loyalty to the Aloft Brand. See you again soon, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",2017
5.0,"No need to infuse the air with that small/fragrance. Your other guests may like it, but I prefer natural air and so held my breath between the front door and the elevator.The room keepers can also be more gentle with closing the doors during their morning rounds, so as not to wake other rooms' occupants.Other than the above points, a good place to stay near French quarter.Truly thankful you enjoyed your stay and while we love the fresh air ourselves, that signature scent can be found around the world at all Aloft hotels. We appreciate the feedback regarding our housekeeping staff and will be sure to share with the department leader to help rectify that problem.Thank you again for your business and hope you'll be back soon,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",2017
5.0,"This place is in the perfect location a short stroll to all the action on Bourbon st and surounding areas (just a pity Bourbon st was dug up during our stay) the hotel had everything we needed ....very comfortable bed....nice clean bathroom plenty of towels and coffee and a great tv There's always next time to see Bourbon in all of its glory, just means you've got to come visit us again. Thank you for staying and we appreciate your business. See you for round 2!!Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",2017
4.0,"My wife booked this hotel for our conference. The room was nice and service was great if we requested anything they were quick to help. We didn't use the pool as it was usually raining when we would have used it. It would be nice to have a restaurant in the hotel although there are several places to eat nearby. The front lobby is kinda cool. Beds were comfortable and we had a good sleep. We wish not all lights were on one switch.Just another reason for you to return nothing better than a rooftop pool on a sunny day!Thanks for staying,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",2017
5.0,"I have to say I had a great stay,...The rooms were very nice and the staff was very helpful....What more can you askThe bar down stairs was nice to have so you did not need to go out if you really didn't want to. They are located within dozen of place for Uber Eats if your staying in. Awesome! Thank's so much for choosing Aloft NOLA for your needs, we hope you'll be back again soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",2017
5.0,"This was our first time staying at Aloft. The hotel is very clean and secure. The bed was amazing and made it hard to go out and explore. Conveniently located blocks away from the french quarter. They also give you coupons if you choose not to have your room cleaned. The Make a Green Choice program is great, especially for those of us who don't prefer our room be cleaned anyway. Thanks for the kudos, see you next time!Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",2017
5.0,"They have great staff, pet friendly, rooms impecable, the coffee in the lobby really good and free, the lobby bar very enjoyable, perfect location, just the car parking should be more flexible and less expensive.We are thrilled to hear of your great experience!

4.0,"This property reminds me of being in northern europe. (esp. Sweden and Danmark) Very modern, few frills, and everything clean and useful. We did have our A/C unit go out, and they responded within minutes. When it happened the next day again....they just gave us a new room. Their problem-solving skills exceeded my expectations. A good team with a good system.Our staff will be thankful for your kind words while we hate you had an issue, we are glad we were able to correct that issue and you were able to enjoy the remainder of your stay. Thanks so much for staying and see you again next time!Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",2017
4.0,"I stayed at Aloft while attending a convention. It fulfilled all I sought. A modern and well run newer hotel away from the citys congestion well suited for a business traveler. It is a 15 minute walk to the convention center or you can take a shuttle one block away. Easy walk to the French Quarter. The rooms are sufficient and contemporary. Housekeeping was spot on and ranks high for cleanliness. The rooms start on the 11th floor so you are well above street traffic. I would suggest as others have to request a corner room with windows to avoid the cruise ship interior cabin feeling if you need it. Nice bar with specials and the rooftop pool is relaxing. Special mention needs to be extended to the hotels outstanding front desk staff specifically, Lindsey and Mark (who also worked the bar). Friendly, savvy, hardworking, and patient- they belong in hotel hospitality and deserve recognition. Their inherent superior communication skills exceed standard service training programs. I happily recommend this lodging while in NOLA!Our staff will be elated to hear of your stay with us. From housekeeping to the front desk and even the bar, it sounds like you enjoyed all aspects of the hotel. We hope to be your hotel of choice when in the Big Easy.Cheers,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",2017
4.0,"Great atmosphere and artiness. Staff was super friendly and helpful and the bar and game room made it really fun to have your friends together. The live music was a nice touch. Breakfast bar a little too snack fish on a NOLA hangover but we enjoyed the access, the accessibility and the easy to use atmosphere.So we will see you and your friends back year again for round 2 ) Thanks for sharing your experience with us and we hope to see you guys again next year.Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",2017
4.0,"Very clean modern hotel with a nice bar on the main floor. They even had a band playing one night. Room was a good size , my only complaint was there wasn't a mirror in the bedroom area , only by the bathroom. Great location, within walking distance of everywhere we needed to go to. The Livealoft program is a great free concert series at most aloft's, so happy you got to enjoy that bit of local flavor while here. Be sure to check for concerts in your area at your local aloft.

See you next time, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",2017
5.0,"Located a couple of block from Canal Street in New Orleans, this hotel provided efficient and highly satisfactory service. The front staff is very helpful. The bed and pillows were VERY comfortable, more comfortable than in any other hotel I have stayed in. Once I had an almost equally comfortable bed in a Hilton, but this was tops. I would definitely return to this hotel chain.Wow! Thankful you've taken the time to share your great feedback with us and the Trip Advisor community. We have the Westin Heavenly Bed System, they do have some items for retail purchase in case you wanted to check those out. See you next time,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",2017
5.0,"Great location about three blocks from Bourbon St. Very friendly staff. I would staff there again. If you take a car remember it cost 40/day to park here, but it cost that to park anywhere in New Orleans.You got it!! Parking is at a premium here in the city but our valet team is first in class and will be sure to take care of you. Thank you for staying, we hope you return again soon. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",2017
5.0,"Clean and modern hotel.5 minutes to walk to the french quarter.friendly stuff.the only negative thing is the expensive valet parking service for about 45 dollars a day.we parked in a parking 2 roads away for 20 dollars per day (perdido street).So glad you enjoyed your time here with us, we hope you return again on your next trip. Valet is an expense here in downtown NOLA but our guys do a great job ensuring our guests are well taken care of. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations",2017
4.0,"My daughter and I stayed here for a Mother's Day getaway. The hotel is in a great location, especially if you're here when they have the Napa Farmers Market located at the edge of the parking lot. There is also a nice movie theater in the same parking lot. This is a new hotel with a nice layout. The housekeeping needs some improvement both in the rooms and the breakfast area. They do offer free wine tasting in the evenings which was nice.",2017
5.0,"The staff is all very friendly, and facility was great! Over all a great experience. Everything for a family Vacation. Also there is a cute little farmers market and movie theater, and restaurants nearby.",2017
5.0,"A gorgeous hotel! Not a typical Hampton Inn. Easy to find and the location is convenient to vineyards, downtown Napa and you can walk to restaurants, shopping and movie theater. Inside the hotel is gorgeous and the guest rooms are all suites and huge! Mini fridge, huge shower, I could live in this room!",2017
3.0,"This hotel was clean, staff was friendly, and beds were comfortable. The ONLY warning I will give is to those couples looking for a romantic getaway in Napa. One of the selling points (in my opinion) on their site was the comfortable outdoor seating area with a beautiful fireplace. If there are private parties booked that area won't be available to you until 10 p.m. We were disappointed and unaware of this as our hotel had private parties every night we were there.",2017
5.0,"This Hampton Inn is new and well-appointed, and seems to be a popular choice for people touring wineries, as our group was. There was a little street noise in my room, but tolerable.The staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful, from front desk to housekeeping.Breakfast is of the standard you would expect for this type of hotel, with some reasonable choices and slight changes from day to day.It is not located in the center of Napa, so to go to most restaurants, you need a car.",2017
5.0,"If you are going to Napa, you must stay at the Hampton Inn Suites. The hotel is very clean, very friendly, and the rooms are updated.

Definitely want to stay at the Hampton Inn Suites again.Dear 48mimiy,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa.

3.0,"The hotel room itself was clean, spacious, and in good repair. We, however, had problems from beginning to end with the booking process. We blocked rooms for an anniversary party. Guests were either told the block was full or didn't exist. My husband and I extended our stay by one day upon check-in. We received 4 phone calls from the front desk by different people asking if we were checking out. Front desk staff was very disorganized and uninformed. I would not recommend this particular hotel.Dear jenniferrB6116DR,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We truly appreciate all your feedback. I will personally be looking into the details of your blocked rooms. We always want to be sure that the entire team is always on the same page and from your comments it looks as if we may have missed a step.

4.0,"I went with my family. The hotel is very new and service is good. On the downside it's far from Napa downtown and farther from the wine yards. Breakfast can get very crowded. There is a cinema and some restaurant at walking distance if you don't want to drive. Good place if you don't want to drive further to get to the attractions. Dear Alejandro M,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We thank you for your feedback and comments. We are located near several restaurants and the Cinema which is very convenient for travelers to the area.

2.0,"We have traveled to all areas of the US and realize high tourist areas such as this are normally higher priced lodging. However, when you pay a higher price for a hotel you expect the establishment to provide an equal value for your dollars. Not the case here. The front desk staff, both in the early evening and in the morning, have very poor customer service skills. We felt we were disturbing them any time we approached them. Also, the walkways and exterior areas have not been cleaned in months. The breakfast was bad! Never again!Dear Don G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We take all of our reviews seriously so we can better serve our Guests. Reading through your review I see the we fell short of your expectations. I apologize for the service that was provided. I will be sharing your comments with my staff, so that we can learn fro our short falls.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager",2017
4.0,"The Fairfield Inn Suites Key West at The Keys Collection in Key West, was a clean hotel, a little out of Key West. There was a shuttle into Key West proper, but it was crowded do to other hotels in the same area give the shuttle free as a perk, at the Fairfield Inn it was 20/ day/ room. We did some things on the side of the island that the Inn on. Key West Botanical Garden, and Lazy Dog Kayak and Paddle Boards which were both great. Overall a good stay, Marriott has to update their breakfasts, have stayed in many Marriott properties, the breakfast is always the same.Dear Thomas M,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel.

5.0,"We booked through hotels.com. When we got to the hotel, it seemed to be taking a long time for the manager, Angel Torres, to check us in. Turns out they were updating their fire code system and all the reservations for rooms with king size beds were being taken out of commission for any reservation that was longer than two nights. He tried to override the computer, but it seems computers are now running the world. He very politely inquired if we would mind a room with 2 beds. I couldn't really understand why anyone would really consider that a big deal, since now I had a bed to throw all my clothes on and another one to sleep in. Once he assured me that the room was the same size as the king I told him to go ahead and do it. He then proceeded to comp us the shuttle (which runs 22/day per room) for our entire stay, as well as giving us coupons for complimentary drinks at the hotel bar. I asked him to also give us free parking to which he responded that he had, the previous week, reversed their policy of charging for parking. I told him to make sure to put that on the website because that could be major deterrence for some people. What more could one ask for!! We definitely came out ahead and he was so apologetic about the whole thing. The room was huge, clean and comfortable. The pool is lovely, the FREE breakfast had a huge variety of items to choose from. No question we would definitely stay here again and will strongly recommend it to any friends who might choose Key West as their destination.Donna, the concierge was also great. Gave great recommendations and lots of coupons for stuff on Duval Street.Thank you for choosing the Fairfield Inn Suites at The Keys Collection for your recent travels to Key West. Commitment to service and guest satisfaction is a main focus and we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay.",2017
5.0,"Great place to stay in the keys at an affordable price without sacrificing quality. Location: not on the beach but within driving/ biking distance to downtown and quiet. On site is a biking company to rent bikes or scooters from definitely recommend. Their kiosk is located next to the pool bar.Room: clean room, clean bedding/sheets, bed was medium comfort but we slept fine Pool: beautiful and big it wasn't crowded at all so you could enjoy it an any time. Lounge chairs were comfortable and cabanas were nice on a first come first serve basis. The pool bar was very nice with a variety of drinks. I wouldn't recommend the pool food with the exception of the wings and fries which were really good. Try some of the local beers on tap my favorite was the Crazy Lady very smooth. Free Breakfast: continental breakfast with a variety of fruits, waffles, eggs, bagels, cereal, and coffee etcOverall : Had a very relaxing and fun two day stay here. I highly recommend it to anyone going down to the keys. I definitely plan to be back here on my next trip down. Dear Susana L,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel.

3.0,"This hotel is conveniently located off 1-10 but for the price we were a bit disappointed. The carpet in the hallway on our floor was very wrinkled, needs to be restretched or replaced and we had a lot of trouble getting our door open as the keylock was rickety and had a sort of personality of its own you had to lean on the door at the same time as putting the keycard in the slot. There was a lot of noise from someone in the room above us, walking or jumping on the floor which of course was our ceiling. It went on for a long time and made it so my mom couldn't sleep so I called the front desk to complain. The front desk clerk must have called them so it stopped for a good while, happened again briefly and then stopped for the night. The breakfast was good, pretty standard for La Quinta and I liked that they had Mexican salsa, fried potatoes and good sized disposable paper coffee cups. I don't like the weird industrial type scrambled eggs at this and other La Quintas because they don't even seem like real eggs at all, more like some liquid egg heated in a microwave. They have little flavor and the texture leaves a lot to be desired. Wish they were real, freshly cooked eggs and that someone in top management at La Quinta headquarters would pay attention and improve that. That would definitely improve my opinion of their breakfasts!Dear Traveler,Thank you for choosing our property for your traveling needs. We are working on plans to renovate the hotel this year. It is our hope you will come back and see us again. Sincerely, Vickie W.",2017

5.0,We had a great stay at The Foundre while in town for a concert. Everything about this hotel was hip right down to the buttons in the elevators. The art was awesome...the Burt Reynolds painting still continues to make me laugh. Be sure to check out the artwork of Phoenix made out of recycled security envelopes and checks...so cool! The room had an industrial-style and were uber-clean. Beds were comfy. Located right next to the lightrail it is an easy ride to the center of downtown Phoenix.

5.0,"this is a fantastic hotel, i think it is a hidden gem located in the arts district of Phoenix. It is a fairly new hotel, very different, in a good way, from your typical hotel. The grounds are spotless, plenty of fun places to eat all within walking distance. I would not say it is within walking distance in the middle of summer in Phoenix to Chase Field or Talking Stick Arena. But the light rail has a stop right in front of the hotel and with your game ticket it is a free ride or for 4 bucks per person you can ride the light rail anywhere all day. Valet parking, only option, is 25 per day but they were great. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Rooms are the best part, very industrial but super cool. Concrete floors with plenty of area rugs.Neat shower and here would be the only complaints. The room is very open, the bath room only has frosted glass between the bathroom and rest of the room. Light from the bath room floods the rest of the room, especially on night runs to the bathroom. And has at least one other has said, you hear ALL noises coming from the bathroom which can be embaressing. We were in room 709, top floor king room with balcony and had an inflatable bed which I slept on (25 per night) It was a south facing room and had a great view of the city. 100 percent recommend this hotel, plenty of art all around. Just a fun place, the hotel is a destination, just like a Disney HotelThank you so much! We're so happy to hear you had such a wonderful stay. Hope to see you again soon.",2017

5.0,"I have to say this hotel more than fit the bill for my five night stay in Phoenix. The valets were always very helpful and prompt (one of them was a hoot). The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Two of the ladies (one in the morning and one in the evening) always asked about my day and were impressed with everything I had been to see. My room was spacious and the bathroom was a bit strange in its layout (sink extends from outside into the shower area), but it grew on me. They gave me plenty of pillows and the bed was comfy My only issue is that the walls are a little thin (or it could have been the connecting doors), cause I could hear my neighbors very clearly a few times. The hotel is located right near US-10 and is in walking distance of the Phoenix Art Museum and the northern part of downtown. Sad to leave but overall a great stay.Hi jehenson81!Thank you for sharing your experience with us. I'll definitely share you accolades with the rest of the team.

5.0,"I stayed in 809, and it was an absolute blast. The view and overall feeling of the suite exactly what I needed. Treat yourself to it, and walk the hotel to view a ton of local art. It's everything I want in a downtown hotel. Beautiful design, comfy rooms, that wow factor, local focused, and friendly staff.Thank you so much for this awesome review! We hope you'll come back and stay with us again soon.",2017
4.0,"I looked around quite a bit for a decent pet-friendly hotel, and this fit the bill nicely. Everyone is very nice and friendly. The hotel itself is very comfortable and nicely appointed. If you like modern hip vibe design, this is a good place to be. It's close to restaurants and the Japanese Friends Garden, a very large park next door (though not sure why they call it Japanese since nothing about it is Japanese). I only had drinks at the bar and chose to eat across the street at the Moroccan restaurant. The bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. The only drawback about this hotel is the lack of sound proofing. My last morning (Saturday), I was woken very early by the person in the room next door with their music blaring. Also, the music from the bar is very, very loud, and there were several people hanging outside the lobby in front of their car with their music turned up so loud it was shaking the windows. My poor dog was so scared. Also, I was gone all day the first full day there, and came back at 830pm to find my room still had not been cleaned. Minor inconvenience.Hi! Thank you for taking the time to write a review! Glad to hear you and your pup had a comfortable stay. There are actually two parks next to us, and you were most likely in Hance Park, not the Japanese Friendship Garden as there is a fee and the grounds there are built and landscaped just as they are in Japan. Perhaps on your next stay we can get you pointed in the right direction. As far as the noise issues you experienced, we are already looking in to ways we can improve this. We apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused for you and your dog. We will also address the issue with your room to see why it hadn't been cleaned while you were away. Again, thanks for this review and we will use it to improve and hopefully see you again in the future.",2017
5.0,"This was one of the most memorable hotels I've stayed at from it's eclectic and fun vibe to the gracious and friendly staff. We were greeted by Angel who was top notch at explaining the hotel re-image as well as was incredibly thorough on explaining the room we reserved, it's accommodations and the awesome tablet that is a connection has everything you'll need from room service to tourist information. I will be coming to Phoenix more often in the coming years and this hotel will be where I will be staying. The room was clean and gorgeous. We were taking pictures for the first few minutes of arriving because the set-up was so appealing and balcony view of downtown Phoenix was breathtaking. We stayed in the balcony king suite and for the price-point it was such a great value. I will be recommending this hotel to anyone visiting central Arizona. Thank you to the staff and management for making a quick one night trip so much fun. You all did a superb job at conveying what your ideology for a great hotel is. P.S. The amount of charging/usb charging ports you have around the room make a techy like me giddy. James! Thank you for making out day! We're so happy to hear you loved the hotel and enjoyed your stay. We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us. We do hope you will come back and visit us again soon.",2017

3.0,"As Christian I found this hotel inappropriate because of what I think were sexually suggestive photos and art work. I would not recommend this hotel for families with children because of the photos and Artwork. Hi Delia, our intention is never to offend anyone. One of our values is community and in that we are inclusive of people of all walks of life. We curate all local art from local artists to support our local community but also to support different values and showcase different views from everyone. We certainly understand that not everyone will enjoy or understand the art, but we thank you for giving us a try. Just as any other contemporary museum, we showcase art that reflects the life and times of the artists we represent here as an art hotel. We do have families who stay here and enjoy it as a learning experience and we hope to continue to provide that for our guests and local community.",2017
5.0,"The Found:Re is a unique hotel is special city: part hotel, part Art gallery, this is one fun place to stay. My wife and I love it for it's ever changing, with new works of Art installed regularly. The property is centrally located, features a nice restaurant, Match, and is just across the street from FEZ, one of favorite eateries outside the hotel proper. The Found:Re is also a short walk from the Phoenix Art Museum, which is on par with some of the best in San Francisco, Denver, Chicago, and New York.We appreciate the kind words!

5.0,"I used to live in Phoenix and I recently moved away. I love this area because of the restaurants and places to drink. I stayed here for a wedding that was at the Phoenix Art Museum and couldn't be happier with my stay. The hotel is very open and has a modern feel. The bar and restaurant are has covered outdoor seating if you want to enjoy some rays while enjoying a bite to eat. The Vietnamese Iced coffee drink was my favorite at the bar. The pool was on the smaller size and there weren't that many loungers to lay on, but there was good sun and good tunes. The studio room was modern, had a ton of towels, 2 bathrobes, and 2 slippers. The room is what I would want in a studio apartment with a comfy bed, a place to sit and drink coffee, and a desk for doing office-y type stuff. I don't like putting my clothes in drawers, so it wasn't a problem for me that there weren't any drawers or cabinets. A lot of places to hang your suits/dresses if you're in town for business or a wedding. Thank you so much for this awesome review. We hope you will choose us again when you make it back it to Phoenix.",2017

4.0,"This hotel provided a stimulated experience with the abundance of local art on display. Pool was wonderful despite the shallow depth (4 feet). I was also amazed at how quiet it was given all of the negative review I read prior concerning noise levels. Hotel is immaculate, surrounded by nice eateries, coffee shops, and bars. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Overall, I had a great time. I like the new artsy vibe in downtown AZ. The only issues we experienced were 1) Bathroom sink kept clogging at night. 2) There are no hooks in the bathroom to hang towels (this we found quite annoying and odd).Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We're bummed we missed the mark in a couple of areas. Our engineering team has actually been going floor by floor to install the bathroom hooks over the past week and are still working on them. Hopefully, next time you visit you'll have them to use. As far as the bathroom sink, we will certainly have someone fix it!",2017
5.0,"We where a late check in and Juliana was so accommodating. I spoke to her a few hours earlier to ask if someone can set up the sofa bed on the room since we where running late and going straight to bed. She did that for us, which I really appreciate. Thanks. The breakfast was delicious and the two attendances where so sweet. I don't remember their names, but I just want to say thanks. The lady that speaks noticed my puertorrican accent and told me that she hopes that everything is good with my family back in the island.

3.0,"HOTEL STAYThe company I work for is located in San Francisco. Last week I was sent down to the Anaheim office for 2 1/2 days from Wednesday to Friday. During my business trip last week I stayed at this hotel for two nights. Originally my boss tried to book my reservation at Ayres Hotel, which according to him was about 220 yards away from the office. However the second night was fully booked. The last minute my boss booked the other closest hotel, which is TownePlace Suites Anaheim. According to Google Maps the location of this hotel is about a 10 minute walk. I've walk from this hotel to the office. The walking time was a lot less then 10 minutes. I cannot compare this hotel to Ayres Hotel at the moment. However this hotel is not only close to the Anaheim office but also is situated with a lot of nice restaurants that are one block away. The room I stayed in was a studio suite, which included a kitchen. There was decent space inside the room unlike most hotel rooms as this room had a couch and kitchen. Twice at night around 9PM I swam at the swimming pool and sat in the whirlpool. The swimming pool was slightly heated while the whirlpool was really heated. Going to the swimming area helped me relax from that day's work. The one main knock I would say is the complimentary breakfast. The breakfast is buffet style with pastry, bread, coffee, eggs, and sausage. Both times I've had breakfast the eggs were overcooked and the sausage was cold. I don't mind if the complimentary breakfast was only pastry and coffee. However if there is hot, cooked food on the complimentary breakfast then items such as fried eggs and sausages shouldn't be stale. Overall I enjoyed my two nights at this hotel during my business trip.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim. It wastruly a pleasure to serve you.We appreciate your business and value your honest feedback.

1.0,"I am a gold elite member with the Marriott brand. We stayed here earlier this month. I didn't have time to get around to making a complaint because we were getting things done for my mother in law's funeral. First off the first room we were given smelled like mildew. It was disgusting. So I went to the front desk and was given a second room next door to this room. It did not smell any better. So I was given a third room this time in the main building. So we move our things to this room. I brush my teeth and get into bed it was then 1:00am approximately. I lay on the right side of the bed and the bed breaks!! I am about 180 pounds why is the bed breaking I fall out of the bed and hit my head on the corner of the night stand. At this point I am beyond furious. I calmly walk back to the lobby and explain to the gentleman. He apologizes and I am given a fourth room. The next morning I go to down to talk to the manager but the manager is in a meeting and the lady at the front desk rudely tells me the guy from night shift comped my room what else do I want. I could've of choked the ignorant lady. So I checkout and move to a different hotel. A manager named Patrick calls and leaves a voicemail the next afternoon. I called Patrick back multiple times and left voicemails. Never received a phone call at all or email nothing. We have stayed at this hotel for almost 5 years in a row. It's the only hotel we stay at in Anaheim. This is beyond ridiculous. Category 6 this place should be more of an 2 or 3. I have stayed at nicer category 3,4,5 hotels. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. Is this the type of name Marriott wants for itself Should I take my loyalty to a different brand Dear floydmcmillan2007,Good Day, Please accept my sincere apology on behalf of Towne place suites Anaheim, I am very sorry to learn that your experience with us during your visit was not up to your par .

When I called the hotel I spoke with Viri, who was super helpful and very friendly. She took care of everything and had a great sense of humor. When I checked in Viri happened to be working with a few others at the front desk. They were all extremely friendly and welcoming. The coffee in the lobby all day is a nice perk. I was unable to enjoy breakfast, but it looked nice as I grabbed an apple and ran out the door to meetings.

5.0,"First time in New Orleans, planned to stay here for 3 nights but ended up staying for 5. Mainly because he owners, Lauren and Daniel are such excellent hosts. Great advice on where to go and what to do, nothing better than a local to give you advice. The hotel was quiet when we were there so Lauren and Daniel sat with us a breakfast and helped us plan our day. Rooms spotlessly clean. All of their suggestions were spot on. Good little pool with sun deck, unusual for a BB. We visited the WW11 museum which is outstanding but allow at least 4 hours for your visit. Burboun St was a disappointment, but go to Frenchman St for great music and food. Try 30/90o bar for music. Highly recommended and within walking distance, is the Lounge (best ribs ever). Another reviewer spoke of the area, we drove down from Houston and arrived about 6pm, we were slightly concerned as the area has some building with a lot of graffiti on them, however they are being developed and the owners said the area has changed a great deal over the last few years, and is becoming one of NO sought after places to live. Its abut a 5/10 minute trip by uber/taxi into the French quarter. Altogether a great place to stay and would highly recommend.",2017

5.0,"After being on a 7 day cruise that left out of New Orleans, we decided to stay and explore the beautiful city of New Orleans. We were with a group of friends who were staying at the NOPSI Hotel, so we decided to book a room there too, and boy were we glad we did. This hotel is virtually brand new, opening in July 2017. The NOPSI Hotel building formerly served as the headquarters of the citys power and transportation company, New Orleans Public Service Inc. Its absolutely amazing how this hotel has been transformed into such a gorgeous and luxurious hotel. As we pulled up to the hotel, we were warmly greeted by the bellmen, Bolton and Will. These gentlemen took great care of us and our belongings. What a great feeling to be welcomed so warmly the minute one arrives at a hotel! The rooms have the most comfortable mattresses, finest linens and all the amenities you could ever want, including robes. They bathroom is quite exquisite, with its grand two door entrance, marble countertops, double sink, and oversized shower.If so inclined, you can choose to indulge in an on sight spa service at the NOPSI Spa. There is an on sight restaurant, multiple bars, one in the grand atrium and one in the restaurant area. Be sure to check out Above the Grid, the rooftop pool and bar. Above the Grid is open to hotel guests and locals, providing everyone with an extraordinary view of the citys skyline. NOPSI Hotel is about a 1 mile from Bourbon Street. Its situated in a perfect location, walking distance from virtually all local attractions. We walked back and forth to Bourbon Street many times during our short stay. On sight parking is available for a fee. You should contact the hotel directly for daily rate charges. Pinot, Thank you for sharing your NOPSI Hotel experience. We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay. It has been exciting for us to finally share NOPSI with our guests. Whether you are dining at one our restaurants or relaxing in one of our well-appointed rooms, we are here to make your stay memorable. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",2017
2.0,"Unacceptable, unprofessional behavior.1. Couldn't get into room because I wasn't on the reservation. 2. Person let into room who wasn't on the reservation.3. Unreliable housekeeping.4. Double-charged for entire stay... WHEN I WASN'T EVEN ON THE RESERVATION.So, to begin... My friend PREPAID with her card for a room for us to share, but requested that my name be added to the reservation since I would arrive in NOLA hours before her. There's a whole email trail to prove they agreed, had my name spelled correctly, etc. I arrived, and they're like who are you I'm tired. I've been traveling. I need to shower, but no. I can't get into the room until hours later when my friend lands and gets it sorted from her Uber. I check us in using my card for incidentals, saying they'd only put a 50 hold on my card if we charged something to the room (we didn't). My friend arrives three hours later, but basically gets into our room about 15 minutes after I do. Once she's there, she tells me a pretty funny story. Her bf and his friends had another room, and even though he never put them on the reservation at all, they gave them keys! I had documentation and couldn't get into my room, and they, complete strangers for all the hotel knows, just waltzed into theirs! A huge security issue!The room itself was nice enough, and so was the pool however, the pool bar closed at random times despite having official posted hours. The bartenders were rude, as was most of the hotel staff (except for the doormen, who were delightful). Our room was only cleaned half the days of our stay. Housekeeping didn't replenish the toiletries when they did clean the room, and with two women, we obviously ran out of shampoo. When we called the front desk, around 10pm, they said they'd run out! At 11pm they came with a bag (and I mean garbage bag) full of.... lotion Because that helps. So both my friend and I showered without washing our hair, only to have housekeeping show up again at 2AM IN THE MORNING, banging on the door, with one bottle of shampoo that I guess they found. Not only was it late, but it was LATE.And now the worst part, to top it all off: Remember when I wasn't even on the reservation Yeah, they charged my credit card on file for a temporary hold FOR THE ENTIRE STAY. After my friend HAD ALREADY PREPAID. They got their before we even stepped in the door, and then double charged a completely different credit card with a completely different name. Yeah, no. You can deal with my credit card company thanks. I'm giving them two stars instead of one because the doormen were so incredibly nice. The nicest I've ever met. They should all get bonuses.And some additional minor points:Doormen: SO NICE! I LOVED THEM!Housekeeping: Good job cleaning WHEN they cleaned (but didn't restock soaps)Pool: Small but really nice, great viewBars: Rude, closed for no reasonFood: GreatBed: ComfortableBathroom: AwesomeNoise level: LOUD but it's not the soundproofing. It's the crazy loud fan/vent.Location: GREATOverall cleanliness: GREATThank you for taking a moment to share your review on TripAdvisor. Your candid feedback is truly valuable.

An every one of my questions where answered wrong cause they made it a point to ruin my night. My friends where not allowed to go to the public bar or swim they told me on the phone the was open til 11. once we got there they said it closed at 8 I guess it was cause we where black an they thought they where talkin to a white person on the phone. They said my guest where welcomed once they got there they stopped them from comin up once again guess it was cause we where black. I will never return to this hotel from hell again. An also they let people order drinks under your room number wit out gettin permission from the person the room is from wow is all I got to say.Dear Sasha, We strive to deliver an exceptional experience for our guests at NOPSI Hotel, but this evidently did not occur during your visit.

5.0,"We recently spent three nights at The NOPSI in New Orleans. Nothing but good things to say. Beautiful first impression - absolutely gorgeous lobby! Extremely friendly and helpful staff - from the doormen, the front desk folks, the concierge - everyone! The location was an easy walk to the French Quarter but far enough away from the not so nice part. And the rooms were great - spotless, comfortable and large. Nice bars in the lobby and on the roof and also in the adjacent restaurant (which had a very good breakfast). All in all, A+!Frank, Thank you for visiting NOPSI Hotel. Our service professionals strive to make our guests feel at home from the moment they walk through the doors. We are honored that our service has earned your recommendation and look forward to welcoming you back in the near future. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",2017
5.0,"This hotel is perfectly located..close enough to walk to the action but far enough way to not be apart of all the hustle and bustle...the hotel is fashionably decorated, comfortable, and the staff is very accommodating! The roof top bar was everything, especially at night!",2017

4.0,"Very nicely decorated in retro fashion. Loved the steamer versus the traditional iron.Very friendly and accommodating staff.Although location is within walking distance to the French Quarter, would not recommend walking late at night. We found ourselves a bit turnaround when walking back from French Quarter. We stopped in at the Emergency Department of Tulane Hospital for directions who advised us that it was not safe to be walking in this area. They called us a cab despite the fare being very short (a few blocks). Thank you for taking a few minutes to share your experience. The comments of our guests are important for others to get a feel of our property and location. Sorry to hear you got turned around, be sure to let our concierge assist you with a map on your next visit.WayneGeneral Manager",2017

5.0,"For someone who had never visited New Orleans before, I could confidently say that the troubadour staff made me feel like I was at home. I was told about all of the fantastic restaurant and bars that weren't tourist traps. The front desk staff provided quite a bit of useful information about the city and were a fantastic resource that answered all of my questions. My room was always immaculate and the housekeeping team was able to accommodate all of my requests. I look forward to my next stay soon.Thank you for sharing your experience. We are excited you spent your first trip to the Big Easy with us. I'm very proud of the team here at The Troubadour and always enjoy reading when guest recognize all their efforts. Can't wait to see you on your next trip to NOLA!WayneGeneral Manager",2017
4.0,My husband and I enjoyed our stay at this property. It was located within walking distance to Canal and Bourbon St. The only unexpected things were the price of parking and the 50 a day hold on our card. The hold is refunded though.,2017
5.0,"The hotel was very clean and the staff was great! My friends and I booked this hotel for my birthday trip and we would definitely stay again. It's near the heart of the city, The French Quarters, and neatly hidden at the same time.Thank you for sharing and Happy Birthday! No better place to spend it then the Big Easy and we appreciate you allowing us to be part of it. Thank you again! Wayne General Manager",2017

4.0,"We stayed here for 3 nights as part of a road trip! The reception staff were lovely and polite on check in! The rooms were comfortable, clean and very funky! The bathroom was amazing! However the toiletries were not replaced when the room was serviced daily. The walls were quite thin and we could hear the guy in the room next door! It wasnt horrendous and it didnt disturb us. It seemed to be very stylish but some of the finer points were missed. The upstairs bar was recommended to us on check in so we tried it out. We were really disappointed with the bar, it was a Monday night, and it was not busy. The staff seemed uninterested in us, we sat down and my dad went to the bar to ask a couple of questions, he was stood there for nearly 10 minutes, we decided to leave when eventually a member of staff spoke with him so we decided to stay. The first drink I wanted was a southern comfort, but they had none. Next I wanted a Gin and tonic but they had no tonic. In the end I had a cider which wasnt very nice. The bar staff continued to seem disinterested in us and we felt like a burden to them. It was nice sitting on the roof top and having a drink but that was the only bit of the experience we enjoyed. We did not use their car park because it was expensive, but it was in a good location for other car parks. We did not want to be in the middle of the French quarter and found that we enjoyed the 20 minute walk to get there from the hotel! It is in a good location for lots of breakfast stops as well. Hello Leah,Thank you for your stay with us. We are pleased to hear that your check in experience went well but we are sorry to hear there were some issues with housekeeping and the service you received at our roof top bar. These issues have been addressed with the team so that we may improve on this. We hope you will give us a chance to win you back as a guest.",2017
5.0,"The Troubadour is a hotel that is clearly run by seasoned professionals. It is modern and beautifully appointed. The staff is friendly and welcoming. The room was spacious, the bed incredibly comfortable , the bathroom had every amenity and the largest and nicest shower imaginable. The rooftop bar was lively, had a great view, drinks and DJ. It is a short walk to the French Quarter. Do not hesitate to stay there!Thank you for taking time to complete a review of your recent stay. I'm thrilled to hear you had an enjoyable stay.

5.0,"stayed here the weekend of the Rock and Roll New Orleans marathon. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. The hotel itself was gorgeous, comfortable rooms and huge bathrooms. My main reason for giving 5 stars was the breakfast and inspirational note that the staff put in my room the night before the race. What a great touch.The only thing I noticed that I didn't love was that I could hear the elevators moving all through the night. My room was right behind them though so I doubt this was a problem on the other side of the hotel. I will definitely stay here next time I am in town. :)We appreciate that you took a moment to share your experience. I'm very excited to hear you were so impressed during your trip to the Big Easy! We always strive to exceed the expectations of our guests and I'm proud to be working with such a great team. Thank you for recognizing all their efforts. We look forward to seeing you again for next years marathon if not sooner, the Crescent City is coming up soon!Thank youWayne General Manager",2017
5.0,"Lovely hotel with an amazing rooftop bar. The rooftop bar is on the 17th floor looks out over the city with couches and sitting areas besides a big bar to sit at. Rooms were decorated nicely with a touch of orange as the signature color. Bellmen and concierge were very helpful with good advice for where to go. It's in walking distance of Bourbon St but wear comfortable shoes There is lots of walking and sidewalks are uneven most everywhere you go. Of course, taxis and Uber are available. Thank you for taking a few minutes to share your experience. Happy Birthday!!! We appreciate you sharing your comments for others to get a feel of The Troubadour and our Monkey Board rooftop bar, we are excited to hear you enjoyed the atmosphere up there. The team will enjoy reading your comments and we thank you for recognizing all their hard efforts. We look forward to seeing you again soon, at least before your next birthday!WayneGeneral Manager",2017
5.0,"This was a very nice hotel. Great location. Staff nice and professional. One stood out for me and was very helpful and fair. Her name is Sarah- Sarah Smile. She upgraded my room due to my room was not ready after the check in time. She was also so helpful with telling us where we could walk to for a great meal. We were able to walk to the Casino, Bourbon Street, Canal Street, etc- it is really a great little hotel in a perfect location. Oh yeah, the roof- we thoroughly enjoyed. Nice mingle spot! Good drinks and food! Don't slip- I heard about and purchased thru Hotwire as not known until I paid for it- great choice-but will book direct next time. I do recommend to your review readers and I will stay there again.Thank you for the wonderful review and recognizing the efforts of our hard working team here at The Troubadour.

We look forward to your next visit.WayneGeneral Manager",2017
4.0,"We had a wonderful trip at New Orleans as we are invited by Tulane University School of Medicine. Me and my spouse were extremely busy with academic commitments. The hotel is very good and near to Tulane School of Medicine. Breakfast is good and service is very high quality. The room is descent, medium size with all the amenities. Bathroom is simply superb. Room service is also praiseworthy. Only draw back is its House Keeping team. One should not keep any valuables or important materials outside as during house keeping things may be missing. One should lock all the valuables in his or her suitcase before leaving the room and kept for house keeping. This issue was serious by nature and we have reported several times on this issue. Otherwise it is a lovely hotel with very friendly front office staffers.Thank you for sharing the details of your stay. We are glad you enjoyed your stay and we appreciate the comments. We do provide a safe in the room for valuabls, in this case I'm aware of the medications that were inadvertently thrown away, I'm glad we were able to retrieve them for you. We look forward to seeing you again soon.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager",2017
4.0,"Pretty good stay, staff was a bit rude and our room was not ready when we arrived. Other than that, it was a good stay. Would go again in hopes of nicer maid services. The door man was very helpful and kind. Thank you for taking a few minutes to share the details of your recent stay. While I'm pleased you enjoyed your stay and our door man was helpful, I'm disappointed that any team member came across as rude. The team works hard to deliver exceptional service, it's clear we failed with your stay. We will discuss with the team to insure this does not happen further. Thank you for bringing to my attention.WayneGeneral Manager",2017
5.0,Everything from the property to staff were delightful. This place lacks a pool however. They pride themselves on authenticity. I requested a late check-out and was surprised to have that shut-down immediately. They did however accommodate an early check-in from 4:00 to 1:30ish.,2017
4.0,"My daughter and I have stayed for 5 nights here during our visit to New Orleans. Very cute hotel, modern design, good vibe, friendly staff! We've got a nice corner room at 14th floor, beds were so comfortable and everything is new and clean! Walking distance from French quarter, Bourbon street, Lafayette square, we didn't even use any transportation beside the street car to get to the City Park. Thank you for taking a moment to share your experience. Our guest comments are very important to us, they allow us an opportunity to celebrate our successes while also finding ways we may improve. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit to New Orleans.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager",2017
5.0,"The Troubadour is excellent. Clean, secure and accommodating. All are super friendly and helpful. Quiet, felt safe and the extra was coffee, hot and ready, in the lobby each morning.

5.0,"Loved the unique ultra modern design! All the employees we interacted with were very pleasant and accommodating. Looking forward to returning to the property to spend a little more time there to explore the Monkey Board rooftop lounge.Dear 200Williamsf, many thanks for your super nice comments about this new and fun life style hotel in The Big Easy! We can't wait for your return for another Monkey Board rooftop bar and dj music experience. Ron Olstad, General Manager",2017
3.0,"The service was pretty awful. Check in took way too long - only one person at front desk who was extremely slow. Requested cab in AM and staff was unable to secure - got own Uber instead. Arrived back at hotel at 6PM last day of stay and room was being cleaned - unacceptable! We went to the front desk to complain and were offered free drinks at Monkey Board and reassured would be completed soon as well as told that hotel was full - that was why cleaning being done so late - not the customer's issue at all and should not be used as an excuse. Major inconvenience as we had been at French Quarter Fest all day and were planning to rest a little before getting ready for dinner. Also, elevator setup is less than optimal. Big line in lobby to get up to bar interfering with guests trying to get to rooms. Also, didn't seem to be separate service elevator from guest elevator - another dissatisfier. Nice looking hotel - rooms were actually very nice looking/well designed and decent location but really need to get the service kinks out before I would recommend to others and/or return. Lots of other great choices in NOLA....Thank you for your comments Josh, I'm very disappointed to read we didn't exceed your expectations. Your concerns have been shared with my Front Office Manager and Director of Housekeeping so that we can improve. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience and know that we can do much better. We definitely want to earn back your trust and certainly your recommendation. I'll be reaching out to you directly to see how we can do that.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager",2017
4.0,"The Troubadour is a couple blocks outside the Quarter which is ideal for driving in and out while there's parades happening. The studio room we had was spacious and comfortable. Nice big shower his and her vanity. Though it had somewhat unsettling, disturbing artwork on the walls. The rooftop bar has a great view of the city but it's sadly not accessible 24/7 but only from 5 pm till last call. They should change that as I'm sure it would be equally enjoyable during the day. The drinks are extremely overpRiced. You're better off bringing your own drinks. I also would've liked to see a pool and whirlpool there but there wasn't. The restaurant had delicious breakfast and pastries and the servers were friendly and accommodating. A couple cons: The carpets in the room looked like they hadn't been vacuumed in awhile and a couple days they didn't stock enough towels or tissue. Also be careful to not leave valuables out, even food. We left some freshly boxed muffins on the desk that we intended to eat later but found they had been taken when we returned to the room hours later. The elevators kept malfunctioning that even the staff found inconvenient. The acting manager, Toriano, the first shift front desk people were extremely friendly, patient, competent and professional and compensated for any mishaps we experienced. They offered us a great deal for Mardi Gras weekend compared to the other hotels in the area. I would definitely recommend this hotel while visiting the city.Thank you for your comments, they are very important to us. They allow us to celebrate our successes, and also look for opportunities to improve. We will certainly share the details with our management team to make sure housekeeping is doing a more thorough job while cleaning the rooms while also taking care with guest items. We apologize you experienced these deficiencies. We thank you for taking the time to share and we are excited to see you again in the future.WayneGeneral Manager",2017
5.0,"I stay at a lot of different Marriott properties and this Courtyard was one of the nicest of the Courtyard brand i've stayed at. It has a big lobby with plenty of seating and a dining area for the Bistro that is very nice. The front desk staff was as usual very friendly and accommodating. They had a room ready for me at 10am when I checked in. Starbucks coffee is served at the Bistro and they have a nice food menu as well. The room was immaculate and the bed was comfortable. Air conditioning was nice and cold. The view of the lake was excellent. I happen to be in Seattle on some beautiful weather days. Clear skies and no humidity. If your doing business downtown and need to see Amazon this hotel is a 6 Uber ride. You could walk to some nice restaurants on the lake or take a short taxi ride for 5. I would suggest Uber from the airport as opposed to a taxi. Uber was a 39 ride and the taxi was a 50 ride.Hi Thomas,Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful experience at Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union. Much appreciated for the comments on commute fairs and the positive feedback about our hotel and staff. Thank you for staying with us and we hope you see you again on your next visit to Seattle.Sincerely,Dan PhamGuest Service Representative",2017
5.0,"Lovely place and very friendly staff. Although no shuttle was available from the Amtrak station, they did offer to send a limo driver. He was waiting for us as promised and charged 25, which seemed very reasonable. Hotel was clean. Breakfast was typical for a free hotel breakfast, nothing outstanding, but certainly more than adequate. Walking distance to key downtown sites.",2017
5.0,"My room was in a wonderful spot - near the elevators, near the gym, near the ice machine. The staff was very helpful. They gave very good suggestions about where to go during my short stay. Sorry, did not stay long enough to have anymore experiences. The only thing I can say is that I was very, very comfortable.",2017
4.0,"This is a nice property, just by the lake union. The folks at the front desk were warm, friendly and helpful. I really liked this gentleman who would even strain his neck if there are lots of people at the reception and and peek out to say welcome back! when I return from office! Ha!There are a lots of eateries by the lake, so that's a win too.Some improvement opportunities - this is the only hotel where I found the housekeeping would just keep the bed and bath but wouldn't clear out used glasses, plates, soda cans etc. Those stuff were there on the table even after housekeeping was done.It would be great to have some variety in their room service. Especially if it rains, people opt to stay in have some food and I found the bistro options very limited.Also, the bistro staff were either very nice or made a bad impression - for instance, this one lady with a curly bobbed hair appeared very rude and made me feel like I am serving her when she came to deliver my food and in another instance, this one man appeared oh so friendly, almost too friendly and the moment I signed the receipt he was looking for the tip amount - making the whole thing feel like a forced show to get tip rather than genuine hospitality.But yea, the property is great and everything is at walkable or short driving distance. Overall 4 star experience.",2017
5.0,"I'm so impressed. I got in late last night, and needed a cab early in the morning, and needed on time. The person I spoke with at the desk confirmed they'd have it there when needed (and I'm sure she meant to, she was very helpful). Well, staff changed overnight and the message didn't get passed on, and even if it had, apparently they're not supposed to do that, I should have called in the morning. When the car wasn't there, I was frustrated. The person I spoke with was very apologetic and tried to help, but when I realized what happened I just immediately booked an uber, and left very disappointed. Things like this are mistakes, no hotel (or person for that matter) is above an occasional mistake, but how it's handled makes all the difference. Tonight I got a personal email from their operations manager apologizing again, which was totally unexpected, and very appreciated. As if that wasn't enough, he also credited me a bunch of Marriott Rewards points in an effort to go the extra mile. Wow. I was amazed! I've had bigger things than this happen, and have just been told basically tough luck. They didn't have to do anything and they did. You could see a small hotel really caring about my experience, but generally I wouldn't expect it from a large chain (or the LARGEST in the world for that matter). My trust is higher now than it was before I checked in. Thank you. Definitely Redeemed. Other than that, normal courtyard, great.",2017
5.0,"We always use Hyatt for all inclusive vacations but this time traveling through the US we decided to try Hyatt House. We were traveling with our 2 dogs - we were a little taken back by the non-refundable pet fee of 75 for nights 1-7, we were only staying one night and thought this was a little steep. However, after checking in and seeing the cleanliness of our room, being a pet friendly room you expect to find at least one sign another dog had been there - Nope! Immaculate! Great cleaning staff!

5.0,"My family and I were surprised at just how good this place is. Given its location right in the heart of Seattle Center and its affordability, we thought for sure something was amiss. Parking in the area is expensive, here it is 25/day with full in/out privileges in a protected garage. The rooms are spacious, with a kitchen (microwave, stove, full fridge/freezer, sink, etc.) with an elevated dining table. Add the spacious bedroom, bathroom, and sitting area and you have a comfortable place for four to stay. The full breakfast is above average but the real hidden gem is the H Bar. We ate here a couple of times and the food is outstanding. The happy hour features a good selection of 3 local tap beers and the place is never really crowded. I'm not sure the tourists know they can come in otherwise I could imagine thirsty and hungry tourists at Seattle Center walking the minute or two to here, having a beer and a bite, and easily going right back to the Space Needle. I searched for the H Bar on Trip Advisor, but it's not there. NOTE TO HYATT HOUSE: You might consider getting the H Bar added as a restaurant if you want to increase your business.Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

3.0,"This hotel is fine. The room was nice and the lobby clean. The buffet was good. My problem is you pay a premium for this hotel due to the location and it really isnt' worth the money., in my opinion. Stay at a hotel farther out and take the public transport system. Our one night stay for a basic room with a king bed was 345. Also, they give you ear plugs on your nightstand. Not a good sign. Bring a noise maker to drown out the noise.Dear TinasB3116Mo,Thank you very much for taking the time to review our hotel and share your stay with us. I very much appreciate the feedback and sorry to hear that you felt the cost did not match the experience of being at the heart of Seattle across the street from Space Needle. Our prices do very through out the year and often are much lower. Also if you are a World of Hyatt member and book directly with Hyatt.com you can save an additional 10 off.I hope you do keep us in mind the next time you are in the Seattle area. We would love to host you again! Most Sincerely,Jonathan",2017
2.0,"We were in town to visit with our daughter and also see my brother. We stayed at the Hyatt House. The staff was friendly but not very empowered. Their directions on the ways you have to use the room key in the elevator and room were not very clear. We heard that over and over again as we went up and down the elevator with other visitors. The room had strange windows that looked out to the hotel interior. We missed having a window to do a quick weather check. The bathroom was spacious but had the most non-ergonomic faucet. Turning it on meant bumping your hand on the lighted mirror above the sink and that was unpleasant. All the elevators stopped working at one point and the staff only offered a free bottle of water despite the significant challenge for the hotel visitors. I observed a person in a wheel chair as one example. No help was offered for getting yourself or luggage to and from the lobby (besides a free bottle of water from the lobby shop). Although sometimes things happen, it is how the staff responds and this was a major disappointment. The free shuttle will take you up to 1 mile away if it is available or you can wait. The breakfast buffet was good, but they did not always restock items (including coffee lids) in a timely fashion. I don't recommend this hotel.",2017
4.0,"We chose this hotel because of the location and we weren't disappointed. Right opposite the music museum, science museum and space needle. Happy Hour at the bar offered a good selection of local beers and wines. The rooms weren't huge but comfortable and clean. The breakfast was buffet style and a little bit busy with everybody having to convene in a small corridor area where the buffet is served but lots to choose from. Omelettes can be made to order. Convenient to walk the short mile to Pike Place and also to savour many of the great restaurants in the neighbourhood. One negative comment is that there are only 2 elevators for the entire hotel, so you could be waiting quite a while for the elevator to come to your floor if it was first thing in the morning and everybody was heading to breakfast. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to guests.Thanks so much for taking the time to leave this review! We are so pleased to hear that you got to experience the neighborhood attractions. We are totally biased, but we think it's pretty great as well! We feel privileged to have had you as our guest - we hope it won't be the last time.

Breakfast buffet was good, and there are ready meals and snacks to purchase from the front desk area if you arrive late and want to rustle up a quick bite in your room.Ideal for families travelling to Seattle this was a comfortable and well equipped base.Recommend and would return.",2017
4.0,"We stayed at Hyatt House Seattle Downtown for two nights. It is a convenient hotel with studio style rooms. It is well located right in front of the famous Space Needle. You have to walk about 15 minutes to Pike Place and the Centre but that is still very convenient. Breakfast was included, but we did not make use of it. They do have a small bar and Happy Hour in the lobby (we did not make use of that either but saw the sign). Staff is very friendly and helpful. It is one of those places where you get exactly what you paid for and know what to expect. Good space, comfy bed, big shower and anything you need to have a comfy stay. Only thing: the elevators are ridiculously slow we stood down waiting for one car to arrive what felt like ages. And we are happy to spend our last night there as well on our way back home.",2017
5.0,"Comfortable, quiet, friendly staff. The lobby is amazing and a great place to meet for drinks. The room I had was small, but functional. Elevators were always available.Overall, this is a nice gem in downtown Philadelphia close to City Hall and restaurants. I highly recommend it.Todd,Being a part of the opening team, I have said from day one, even during construction, that our lobby would be the most beautiful and exciting in the city. It is always great to hear that our guests such as yourself feel the same! Our team is always working hard to ensure that you have a quiet and relaxing stay, and I am glad that you felt we were successful in that attempt. I hope we see you again soon!Best,Andrew DrydenAssistant General Manager",2017
5.0,"The Aloft hotel is in an excellent location, it is right next to city hall and the market and walking distance to so many other shops and restaurants. The hotel itself is extremely clean as was the hotel room. The room was on the smaller side, but if you're like me and my husband, you're not there to spend all your time in the room. It was plenty of space for the two of us. The bar downstairs is nice, we each enjoyed a cocktail there one of the nights. The only negative I would say is the expensive valet parking, however we went one block north on broad st and found parking for 15 dollars a day. Overall a great stay and highly recommended. Lindsay,Thank you for your kind words! We truly are fortunate to be in the heart of so many great things that Philadelphia offers. I am so glad to see that you enjoyed your stay so much, and that you were able to relax not only in your room, but at WXYZ Bar as well. I look forward to welcoming you back the next time you visit our fine city!Best,Andrew DrydenAssistant General Manager",2017
5.0,Great stay at this hotel. The staff are wonderful! The hotel is very close to City Hall and Reading Terminal. Great outdoor patio and fun lobby. The rooms are nice and bed comfortable. Hallways are a little narrow but is an older renovated building. Definitely would stay here again.,2017

4.0,"The Saint is about as well located as any place in key west. There are 2 (hidden) side entrances/exits as well as the main one on Eaton street. if you use a gps, DO NOT enter the Duval street address -- you will end up going in circles.Main entrance is up a few steps. you can park in front for 15 minutes, and if you have luggage, go inside and ask for help.room 113 is on the main floor, and mostly dark since the shutters need to be kept shut during the daytime (there is a busy walkway right outside and anyone can see in -- for same reason, it can be a bit noisy at times)the entire property is funky, in a playful way. photos on this site will show you why.staff is friendly and anxious to please. any major problems should go to the general manager, abraham, who is eager to make the hotel as good as possible.oh, the location. no car is needed. you are 5 minute walk to truman white house, 10 minutes or less to mallory park/sunset pier. also greene street is the same area and has a lively night life as well as key lime pie stores every few steps.hemingway house is towards the other end of Duval street, but can be reached in less than 20 minutes if you don't stop at all the stores and eateries along this main street. go another 10 minutes or less, and you will be at the end of Duval, and reach the southernmost point in the continental u.s. -- where the famous buoy sits. you may need to wait on line a few minutes to take a photo at that spot. also, a great cafe right on the beach there. finally, for dinner, you can almost throw a dart and find a terrific place within walking distance of the saint. have fun!Dear ischloss,We greatly appreciate that you took the time to write such a thorough review about your recent stay at The Saint Hotel Key West. We hope that when your travels bring you back to Key West, you will once again choose The Saint and give us another to earn that 5-star rating!Cheers!",2017

5.0,"We stayed for New Years Eve 2016. From the minute we walked in the door we were treated like preferred guests. Abraham and Maria made us feel right at home. They were even kind enough to keep the bar open so we could enjoy a drink after a long day of travel. Paul, Lane, Justin and Jess were all fantastic behind the bar. The Shipwreck was out of this world and Paul should be nominated for Sainthood for the way he makes this drink. Overall, we had a fabulous stay. The pool was warm and with some adjusting of chairs we were able to catch some sunshine. The hotel location was absolutely ideal. We walked everywhere and there were wonderful places to eat and drink all around us. This is the place to stay in Key West! Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you were able to indulge in one of our delicious drinks. We will be sure to pass along all of your kind words to each staff member you mentioned. Please come back and see us!",2017
5.0,"A hip vibe and soothing lounge music greet you at this fairly new, white-clad, 36-room property located steps from Duval Street, the main drag in Key West. Staff seem a bit over-taxed at times but they bend over backward to assist with everything from meals, room service, taxis, and logistics. Service was excellent, starting with the smiling assistance of bellman Gustavo, who is helpful, not to mention easy on the eyes. Rooms are simply decorated in a modern white motif with blue accents. Blue lighting predominates on the exterior, too. Many of the rooms open with balconies and patios to a lap-style pool crowned by a waterfall and Buddha at one end. Careful - they do have some rooms accurately billed as petite that would be cramped for a couple. My Superior King was spacious enough and comfortable, and was part of the new remodel/construction. You may want to request a newer room. The location cannot be beat. It sits in a relatively quiet block of the otherwise clamorous Duval Street. Through a side gate you step right onto Duval. Go left and hit all the iconic bars from Hemingway days. Go right and there are more of the same, including all of the gay bars and clubs that are only 4 to 6 blocks away. I walked to the marina for several excursions, to the southernmost point and south beaches. The hotel has bikes available at no charge. I only needed a taxi to get to the airport and far-off marinas for some of my excursions. Overall, this property served me well. Its common spaces are chic and modern, the rooms are comfortable, and the people working there make things as easy as possible.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay with us. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time and the amenities of our property! We will be sure to pass along all of your kind words to our employees so that they know their hard work is appreciated. Please, come back and see us!",2017

5.0,"My wife and I recently moved to Vegas, and come here fairly regularly. We recently visited Salvatore's Italian restaurant for our anniversary dinner. This place is right out of Good Fellas - great ambiance, and old school vibe with great food. We've never stayed here, but always enjoy gambling here and coming for an occasional drink, or to watch a movie at the theater.",2017
4.0,"Went to eat at their buffet. They have a variety of foods. Good food for a great price. If it's your first visit, you get a discount on the buffet. We also did a little bit of gambling.

4.0,We had a wonderful stay at the Suncoast our hotel room was facing the pool and the views were absolutely perfect. It's very nice to visit Las Vegas and kind of get out of the rat race of downtown. Nice location about 20 minutes from the strip. Hotel was very clean plenty of stuff for the kids to do also the arcade was inexpensive and the gentleman that work there was very helpful. The pool area was beautiful and they also have bowling with tons of lanes and a movie theater which neither did we get to explore. We were there to visit family and kind of busy running around. I would Highly recommend this hotel to people visiting with kids to Las Vegas. Pictures are Views from our room 455. The only reason I did not give it an excellent is because you have to walk through the casino to get to the hotel room and you feel like you smoke a few cigarettes by the end of the Walk. I'm not a cigarette smoker,2017
5.0,With several shows going on everything near the strip that is reasonable was sold out.I stay at Coast Casino hotels most often when in Vegas so decided to try the suncoast. Yes it is a bit off the beaten path but you're back in the action in 15 minutes... That said the rooms are big as are the bathrooms the staff is super friendly and the restaurants are great...If you like Golf...you're right next door to Angel Park Golf club...didn't have the time to try it out but the reviews are good.,2017
4.0,Decent hotel. Nothing fancy. Just the basics. Even the casino area is quite small and only has basic games and machines. If you need a clean room to just sleep in. This is the place. If you need excitement. Then this is not the place for you.,2017
3.0,"I just got back from my 4 night stay here at the SunCoast hotel. I have to say that rooms are spacious, nice and very clean. Valet staff was also nice and was understanding when I forgot a couple items and the gentlemen who helped us carry our bags was very kind and welcoming as well. On the other hand, costumer service is very bad.Front desk staff is horrible. At some point, there was three families in line and all three of the front desk agents were looking at their computer screens completely ignoring that they had guests waiting to check in and check out for about 5 minutes (didn't even look up once). One afternoon I tried to order room service at around 2:40 and to my surprise the lady on the phone advised me that there wasn't anyone to take my order at the moment. So If i wanted to eat I had to go downstairs to the restaurant. At the restaurant, the staff was welcoming. They seated us quickly. But their attention to detail was missing. I had asked for a drink with ice and they would forget the ice. I order a plate a fruit which they completely forgot and tried to charge me for it. Thankfully I remember and got the charge voided. At the check out, a lady with white hair helped me and when I asked her for a bill she replied in a rude tone, Yeah! That's what I'm doing. Might not sound like a bad response but it's the way the person says it that has a bad effect. When I first arrived I immediately thought this was a beautiful hotel. Which it is, but I do believe the staff needs to have some costumer service orientations. (Or perhaps consider hiring younger more friendly people). Hello Angy F,Thank you for your recent visit and for leaving such thorough feedback! At Suncoast, we view all criticism as constructive and rely on it to provide better service and entertainment for our guests. Our team members strive to be friendly and personable during every interaction and are taught that service should always be prompt and accurate. It is disappointing to learn that we were unsuccessful in meeting these high standards during your time with us and I am sorry that it caused you to have less than a five star visit. Your comments will be forwarded to the appropriate management so that they can address and resolve the issues you have reported. Again, I apologize that you were not able to enjoy the high quality service Suncoast has become known for but urge you to visit in the future to experience the improvements caused by your comments.",2017

4.0,"We stayed in a small queen room for 2 nights. The room is small, but comfortable. I will say, however, that the bed is on the hard side and not the most comfortable. The sheets have a papery feel to them as well. But the pillows are fluffy. Not the typical hotel bed where you feel like you're sleeping on clouds, but it does the trick, I suppose. Still, all in all, the staff is friendly and the location is really convenient if you'll be spending time downtown. The room is quiet and the wifi is free. It's also affordable. Based on that, I recommend it.Dear Ann C,Thank you for your recommendation!

5.0,"We had a couple of days to spend in Chicago and wanted a hotel close to our car rental and to a train station, this place fit the bill. It's right in the middle of downtown Chicago and within walking distance to pretty much everything. It wasn't too cheap compared to normal hotels but all the other hotels close by were a lot more expensive so it felt like a good deal.It's a very simple lobby with just a couple of people in the reception and you could check in via a touch screen. There was a restaurant right next by but we didn't try it. There's plenty of restaurants and shops everywhere close by anyway.We ordered a room with two beds because of our kid and was expecting two beds close together, but we got a huge room which was pretty much two rooms in one with a hallway in between. It had two TVs and two bathrooms. I don't know if we just got lucky and got the biggest room they had for that price or if they're all like that. It was a great surprise for us and our kid could even play hide and seek with us!",2017

Great value for money. I thoroughly recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.Dear azelinaf2017,Thank you for giving us a perfect rating and for recommending our hotel to other travelers.

5.0,"I stayed at this Motel 6, 311 Courtland St NE, Atlanta, GA, in August last year for a conference my job would not fund. I was totally on my own dime and so needed to economize. What a great deal this place was! The conference hotel was the Hilton literally next door, and those poor schmucks over there were paying over three times what I paid! For the same location! My room at the Motel 6 was clean, the bed was comfortable, the parking was FREE, AND I had a small balcony off my room on the 2nd floor! The staff was nice - what I saw of them. Granted, the staff at Motel 6 is small - there is no room service, no restaurant, and no bar at Motel 6. But they have all that at the Hilton next door and all over downtown Atlanta so Motel 6 doesn't need it!!! I will stay at this Motel 6 every time I have to go to Atlanta from now on. The location is perfect. I felt as safe as anywhere else I have stayed in Atlanta. What a sweet deal!",2017
1.0,"I booked my reservation on Motel 6's website. Upon arriving I requested to see my room before checking in. The hotel clerk refused my request and stated that it is the companys policy NOT to allow a person to see a room until after checking in first. (This should have been my first clue to leave.) The hotel clerk stated that after I have checked in that I could inspect the room. Furthermore, the hotel clerk stated that if the room was not satisfactory that I could leave without being charged. Both the room and the building were not satisfactory. It was 90 degrees in Atlanta on my visit and my room as well as the hallway in the building was hot and was not as comfortable as it should have been. The ice machine in the building hallway was in desperate need of repair because it was making an extremely loud humming sound that could be hear all the way down the corridor. The sheets on the bed needed to be changed. The hotel clerk refused to change the sheets and stated that if I wanted them changed that I had to remove the sheets myself. I have never heard of such nonsense. Lastly, the amount of money that the hotel wanted to charge me was 18.00 higher than the amount I was quoted when I made my reservation. Thus, with the bad conditions as well as the bad attitude of the staff, I left Motel 6 the SAME DAY and checked into the Marriott for just 7.00 more than what Motel 6 was charging per night. However, the Marriott gave me a free breakfast each morning compared to Motel 6 only serving coffee.The Motel 6 hotel clerk did not refund me the full amount of the charge to my credit card account. My credit card was charged for one night's stay. I wanted to get out of there so badly that I did not argue with the hotel clerk. I just disputed the charge with my credit card company and received an instant refund. So for the reasons cited above is why I would not recommend this hotel.",2017
5.0,"I cannot recall the last time I had an issue at a Drury Inn. Well, we did not have one at this location. The room was comfortable, the staff was attentive and helpful, and it was nicely priced more importantly, we got the last available room for the evening. Next, their complimentary breakfast was good, as well as their late afternoon meal from 5 PM 7 PM. Also, you have to have a key card to access their customer parking area. It was a nice feature which prevents people with ill intentions from driving around scoping out the scene.",2017
4.0,"We spent 1 night here before a flight out of Atlanta.Pros:Super friendly staff. When we checked in the lady in reception was immediately welcoming and happy to answer my questions. Then the guy that shuttled us to the airport the next morning was just as friendly. In fact he got off the bus at the airport to unload our luggage and explained step-by-step how to get to the international terminal. Great staff!Breakfast: awesome! Sausage and eggs were delicious. They had so many choices!Room: huge room with great a/c. Two tvs and plenty of storage space. There was some dried soap on the shower wall that probably should have been cleaned before we checked in, but it's just soap, so no big deal. Also worth noting: I never heard an airplane during the night. I was worried that staying so close to the airport would be loud, but it wasn't at all. Park fly parking area is closed off and well-lit. Hopefully my car is safe. If not I'll edit this review to reflect any issues. Cons:We had an issue with the plumbing in our room. We were only there from 8 pm to 6 am so I can't say whether this was ongoing or resolved, but the toilet didn't flush well. Like it was almost backed up, but it would still flush a little. Also, it would be great if the hotel had a luggage scale. I would definitely stay here again! Con",2017

Would stay again!We are so glad you enjoyed your stay with us and hope you will come back and see us again",2017
5.0,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. First off the staff ---every single staff member--- was helpful, courteous and went out of their way to go extra mile to make sure our stay was great. The housekeeper even took the time to arrange my kids stuffed animals in fun and creative ways. Second this was the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed at. I'm a slight germ a phobe so hotel rooms can bother me. I was so comfortable in the room because it was so clean. Third, the breakfast was good and had a nice variety. Lastly the little touches like the lemon water at foyer, the milk and cookies at 8 each night and the treasure box for the kids at check out all made the stay extra memorable. Thank you for a wonderful stay. Heather",2017
5.0,"This is by far the best Hampton Inn my wife and I have ever stayed in, and we've been in quite a few. For that matter, it's one of the best of its class among all of the hotels we've known. We had a nice, clean suite, quiet, well lit, neatly arranged with a desk/divider between the very comfortable bed and the sitting area. Staff were friendly and polite, the breakfast good, prices reasonable. Little notes left by the cleaners were a nice touch. Our only complaint was that the wireless Internet kept dropping out on checkout the desk clerk apologized and said that the hotel has been trying to solve this problem (our room also had an ethernet cable, unusual these days, but I hadn't brought an adapter for my laptop). In spite of this - not enough to affect the rating - highly recommended!",2017
2.0,Nice property and rooms but the service was awful. Hard to get attention from front desk. Multiple requests needed to get issues resolved. It's a big hotel but doesn't have the customer service needed.,2017
5.0,Our family had an awesome experience here! Just incredibly clean and up to date suite. Loved the kitchenette. Very quiet and safe. Comfortable beds and a polite staff. Very affordable. Will come again!!,2017
3.0,"First off, the bed was super comfortable. But... Room cleanliness could be better, linens stained, breakfast worse than most, on the very end of strip bordering sketchy neighbors. Lots of other choices in area.",2017
4.0,"The hotel staff makes you feel welcome. The rooms were clean and fresh. This is a great place/location to stay, the hotel was in an area where I felt safe and local area clean. there was several resturants and stores in walking distance.Thank you taking the time to complete the survey.We look forward to your future visits with us. Vina GM.",2017
4.0,"Nice hotel with very friendly staff. The hotel has recently remodeled their rooms, they are clean and comfortable. Great location for restaurants exploring old town Portland. This is not a high end property, but very nice for the price convenience.",2017
5.0,Beautiful hotel. Rooms clean. Pool very nice. Restaurant in hotel was excellent- food and mix drinks delicious. Only critique would be needing to ask for more than 2 towels (in a room we checked in with 4 ppl).,2017
5.0,It was a great experience I would recommend them to anyone,2017
3.0,Rudeness at front desk. When we checked in the front desk person was unfriendly and short of patience with my hard of hearing issue. We witnessed a very insulting exchange from a front desk person to another guest. Housekeepers were very pleasant and helpful. Rooms were small and did not seem up to the Doubletree standard we have seen in other Doubletree hotels.,2017
3.0,Hotel was beautiful. Parking is weird. Paid 20 a night or you have to figure out how to park outback for free. No microwave or fridge in room only avaliable in suites. They kept messing up on room charges. Charging a 150 deposit fee saying it's a 50 fee per night you stay. Didn't make sense. Double charger a friend who was staying in the room next to ours. The staff was nice. I think it was a lot going on due to graduation season.,2017
4.0,Needed a bed that was supportive not lumpy. Too much constru tion noise outside. Need to go around building not to have to climb steps to get to room.,2017
4.0,"This is hard to do because the owners are really nice, but I have to be honest. There is a smell that seems to be in every Days Inn I've ever stayed in. Like..the rooms have a TASTE to them that isnt pleasant. I'm not talking about smoking rooms. My room was non-smoking, and it had that taste. I think it may be a product/room freshener or something that lingers. The furniture had sticky spots even after the room was cleaned, and I think its from that product. The smell gets all in your clothes, cigarettes..not good. Would I stay again Maybe. The pool was fun. The Asst Manager came to help me with an appliance issue, and while he did some things, he was supposed to come back and he never did. The pool was fun. There are all kinds of shopping and food around there. Wal-Mart/Golden Corral around the corner, good food right next door (mostly fried food though). Would I stay there again Maybe..but only AFTER seeing/smelling my room first.",2017
3.0,The hotel was perfect for a place to lay your head. Conveniently located.,2017
2.0,"My daughter and I stayed for one night. I checked in around 8:00 PM and no one was at the desk and there was no bell or any other way to notify staff we were waiting. After a short wait someone came in from a side office area and checked us in, but made no acknowledgement that we were waiting. Shortly after we got to the room I picked up the remote to turn on the TV and found the back cover for the batteries was missing. I pressed the power button on the remote and the TV did not turn on, thinking that because the cover was missing it was the batteries. I removed the batteries and put them back in but that did not work. I then tried to turn on the TV directly and still no power. After tracing the power cable I found that it was unplugged. The power cable would not reach the wall outlet so I plugged it in to the desk lamp on the counter next to the TV. Later that night I saw what looked like a roach crawling on the wall in the bathroom. The bathroom was the size of a small closet where the door had just enough clearance to open before hitting bathtub. There was maybe 3X4 floor space in the bathroom itself. The bed was extremely soft.",2017
2.0,"I understand that this is an older hotel, but I would hope with the Days Inn name, it would be kept up better. The rooms are in drastic need of updating. The room was not as clean as one would expect, and the elevator was dirty. As far as the free breakfast....disappointing doesn't begin to express it. One guest advised one of the staff members that the hot food was not being kept at the required temperature (in fact, it was cold) and there was NOTHING done. The milk for the cereal was left in a pitcher on the counter to get warm. The staff that we encountered was pleasant, but it was not enough for my husband and I to stay there again.",2017
4.0,very comfy just wished we had a couple more blankets for us.,2017
4.0,I was bitten by something in the room and when I brought it to the attention of the staff it was minimized by general manager. Poor customer service when initially I wasn't asking for a refund or any compensation. I now will go to the doctor and have them tell them that they are some type of insect bites.,2017
5.0,Service was excellent,2017

1.0,"Hair all over place, shower curtain rod broken and couldn't keep closed, water went all over floor, insense sticks sticking out vent and cover burnt, hair dryer didn't work, wrong insert for coffee non usable, room didn't get cleaned at all next day. Staff not knowledgeable at front desk, housekeeping was told to come to room and never showed. Maintenance did show and was ok but not the most interactive. Front desk no apologies given. 1 of our worst stays ever.",2017
3.0,Was only there to shower before hitting the road back home but the rooms were nice and clean. There were minor flaws such as dings and dents here and there but other than that it was a basic hotel.,2017
3.0,"I have visited this hotel twice now. On the first, I enjoyed a king-size bed and a clean room however, on my second visit to this hotel I found that the bedspread had a visible stain on it as soon as I entered the door. The towels which were meant to be white didn't appear to have been bleached at all, so they were dingy. On the floor leading to the bathroom was a red stain which I cringe to imagine what it consisted of. Overall, the room wasn't as clean as the one I enjoyed on the first visit.",2017
4.0,The room had a funny smell and also dirt around the mirrors and stains on the sheets. The microwave also didn't work. Besides this it's a nice hotel And a great location. Oh and late check is only an extra 30 minutes not an hour.,2017
2.0,The temperature in the room was inconsistent. It was either to hot or to cold. The unit did not maintain the temperature I selected which was really uncomfortable at night while trying to sleep. The fabric shower curtain was dirty. It had stains and what appeared to be dried up shampoo with hair.,2017
1.0,I would sleeep on the street rather than this Motel.,2017
5.0,What a pleasant surprise. All rooms have a great view and are clean. Staff is friendly and helpful. This hotel is a real value.,2017
3.0,"Nice hotel with beautiful views. Business trip so unfortunately only stayed one night, but will definitely return.",2017
5.0,"This hotel was perfect for a girls trip over labor day! For years we'd gone to Ocean City but this year we did not want to get overrun with labor day crowds and we happened to find Chincoteague. It was the perfect choice, even on labor day the traffic was minimal, it was quiet and the beach was not very crowded at all. The hotel is a short 10 minute drive from the beautiful beach so we could go any time. The room was very clean, updated, comfortable and spacious with a gorgeous view of the bay. Swimming in the outdoor pool overlooking the water makes you feel like you are on a tropical island. The staff is incredibly nice, helping us with directions and anything else we needed. It made a huge difference that we could pay a little extra and extend our checkout time to 7pm! We were able to have a whole extra day at the beach before having to pack up and go home, it was great! We are looking forward to our next vacation at the Comfort Suites!",2017

3.0,"Decent , Hotel needs to be updated.",2017
3.0,"Arrived early to combat traffic. Despite knowing that check-in was 4 pm, I asked that morning about the possibility of an early check-in and was told absolutely not. I returned about 3 pm to find many people checking in ahead of the 4pm deadline I was given. The carpets are worn and aging rapidly, the walls need a new coat of paint desperately. The staff was pleasant if not a little understaffed. It was a holiday weekend but this hotel is not worth the premiums they are charging.",2017
3.0,good,2017
5.0,"We arrived at almost midnight after a long day of flying in from out of the country.

5.0,"Upon arrival, we were welcomed courteously. The receptionist gave us a corner room with a convertible sofa bed. The extra space gave us plenty of room to place all the things needed for the wedding. The daily breakfast which were delicious was very convenient to start our daily activities. The housekeeping staff were very accommodating and courteous and helpful. The security staff were always present near the front door and very welcoming",2017
2.0,"First off there is no parking, valet is your only option which would be fine if it were a better hotel. Our AC didn't work, maintenance had to come reset it three times. Very inconvenient at 8pm, 11pm then again at 1am. The pool is a joke, it's more like a bathtub. And the amazing breakfast they advertise is no better than a Continental at most hotels. Over all it was a huge disappointment.",2017
4.0,"What's really unpleasing is that the hotel has no windows that can be opened and the air conditioning system has old filters, as much as I can say. There's a 'smell' of old air throughout the hotel and in the room (I was), which could only be explained with less than efficient functioning of the a/c system.",2017
4.0,"It was a wonderful stay however for some reason money was transferred out of my bank account towards this hotel for 86 and nobody knew why which was disappointing. However, the stay was great.",2017

4.6,Construction across the street Nice location,2017
4.8,"Good: We liked that breakfast was served until 10am. Traveling with young adults and children, it makes for a hectic morning when we have to get to breakfast by 9am. It was a nice, short walk to the Maryland Science Museum and National Aquarium. We were prepared for below average temperatures, so were able to enjoy our stroll around the harbor. We also appreciated that we were able to keep our vehicle parked at no extra cost for several hours past checkout time.",2017

3.55,"Bad: the hotel was just ok the employees were friendly and helpful but the area is a little rough, had to walk 4 or 5 blocks before you found anything going on other than other hotels. The area outside of the hotel is dirty up and down the streets.",2017

5.0,"Bathroom had no soap,tissues. Took over 1/2 hr to get car Very friendly staff",2017
4.15,Bad: The bathroom could have used a better cleaning before check in. There was hair left in there from someone else. Good: The nicest friendliest staff ever! So accommodating to our needs.,2017
2.9,"Bad: The room we had was situated next to an electrical room, which was noisy and loud throughout the night. We did not have a refrigerator for our drinks, and we asked manager re: both. She said she would take care of the problem. Unfortunately, she did not bring the refrigerator or move us to another room. We should have at least had our room charge reduced, but t no avail. I told the hostess when I gave my keys about the problems, all she said was, I'm sorry.. Good: Location, proximity to US 60 and downtown Williamsburg",2017
3.15,Bad: The air conditioner was horrible. The sound of the unit running made it impossible to hear TV. We woke up each time during the night. I commented about it to the desk in the morning.

4.6,"Bad: Probably my oversight when Iread the description but I was surprised to find no mini fridge in the room. Good: Close to Colonial Williamsburg, clean with a friendly staff, and two great pools. The pools gave us downtime opportunity on a rainy day as well as on a sunny day.",2017

5.0,"We were very pleased with the room and thought the location of the hotel was great. It was a no hassle experience to bring our dog which was wonderful. The only negative was that they couldn't find our reservation right away, but that may have been because we have a two part last name.",2017

4.8,"Bad: 195 a night (including resort fee) is expensive but it is Miami and all hotels seem to be this much, I cant fault the hotel so its a case of pay up and smile!. Good: Excellent location at the quiet end of Ocean Drive but still within walking distance of bars and restaurants, beach, shops and local buses. Very comfy beds, beach towels and chairs available for use. Free glass of wine on an evening was a nice touch.",2017
3.35,"Bad: being told we had missed our free glass of wine as we arrived to late, how hard would it have been to just give us a glass, also being told no free breakfast included as we booked via bookings.com, when you book with bookings.com you want to feel valued not at a disadvantage. no kettle, what is it about Americans not putting a kettle for a nice cup of tea in each room, you will get liters of alcohol to buy but why not just put a 12 dollar kettle and two mugs, costs so little but means so much. would boost my scoring on every hotel review i do. Good: position on south beach road is great, roof top pool great, nice room, hotel a little tired, stained carpets cracked bathroom work tops etc. my advice would be replace carpets in room halls ways from lift to room. lots of stains. iced water by lift this is great. lovely bed and pillows.stayed one night, lovely lady on reception day we left, helped us get a taxi. I would stay again however its expensive a bottle of water in the room is about 6 dollars, drank in error not understanding it was a cost option. drink iced water in reception, very nice.",2017

4.6,"Bad: Hotel restaurant was good but a bit pricey. Good: Very good value, located across from the beach but several blocks south of the chaos and noise. If arriving by auto, be aware that parking in MB is a problem. Private lots charge 30-40/day. I suggest parking in municipal garages within walking distance for half the cost.",2017
4.15,Bad: Internet connection not great from my room. Good: Quiet and great bed... But room a bit dark and no view. Super service and boutique feeling to everything.,2017

3.15,"Bad: I had made my reservations 3 months ago for a 1 night stay for my friends aND I. We have been making this trip for 40+ years, and are certainly used to paying premium hotel rates for very average hotel rooms due to the season and oceanfront property. However this hotel room was very disappointing. We were given a handicap access room.Keep in mind, we are able bodied, active middle-aged ladies who rin marathons. This room had a bathroom that provided a shower stall for a wheelchair access, thus no way to prevent water from the shower head to go all over the bathroom. What a mess! We basically had to sop up water from the floor after each of us showered. The rooms only provide double beds, so even for the smaller ladies, was a cramped sleeping experience. Upon registering and first entering the room, I asked if we could have another room option.The front desk declined indicating that other rooms were not available.So, we paid over 350 a night for a below standard room. They should have at least offered us a discount. We will seek other accommodations for our annual trip next year!. Good: Location is great. Easy access to the boardwalk and beach.Decent hot and cold complimentary breakfast.",2017
3.15,"Bad: dated, needs face lift and upgrades, rusted and moldy areas inside room, stains on ceilings and closet doors, shower head leaking, sink cracked, small TV for room size, room phone old and crackling when trying to use, food buffet cold and stale - potatoes hard and egg omelettes rubbery, pool small, exercise room even smaller, can't control non-stop planes taking off but would be nice to inform the guests in advance - very loud and ear piercing - constant for hours and hours.... Good: convenient location and breathtaking views, fair price for location, decent parking, coffee and ice water 24-7!",2017

5.0,Bad: Coffee could be better quality. Good: The position if the room at the ba k away from the street was excellent. There was no bar so no young noisy people!! Yeah!! The veranda and the garden area was well shaded so could sit out in the cool. Near shops and two minutes to beach.,2017
3.75,Good: Boutique type hotel. With At Home Feeling. Nice atmosphere for the price!,2017
4.8,Good: All around for value,2017
4.6,"Bad: Could have initially had more room towels. Good: Villa Paradiso was minutes from the beach. The hotel also provided BEACH towels daily so you didn't have to worry about the hassle of towels. The room was fully equipped with a kitchen. Great for late night snacks or meal and keeping leftovers cold in the fridge. I felt very secured at the hotel. The outside gate had its on key so that was a bonus. Walgreens is right across the street, we may have visited it a dozen times. Will book again when I come to MIAMI.",2017

3.0,"We were there to just stop for a night on our way to the outer banks... although I will admit that our drive down was horrible, so we may have been more sensitive than normal, but this place had zero options for food or drinks. In addition, we were going to have our son just sleep on the floor, but my husband saw bugs all over the side wall... For the upcharged price, this is a no go in future. Will sleep in car next time and save 200",2017
5.0,Great room! Plenty of space for 4 people,2017
5.0,This is a beautiful hotel! The staff was excellent and we had an awesome stay. I recommend renting the bikes and riding over the bridge to downtown Long Beach. The evenings with all the fit pits and torches lite are amazing. I will stay again!Thanks for the great review. We love that you loved it. Come back soon.,2017
3.75,The rooms were fairly loud and the bed were just okay. There also was not a lot of restaurants around that were open past 10 so if you like to eat late like us it might be an issue. Great breakfast with lots of variety. Nice to have the shuttle even though there were limited times. We took it when we could other wise just used uber which was not really a problem for us. The room also had a little fridge and microwave which was great for storing and having snacks.,2017
5.0,"Bad: The breakfast is very repetitive, but still good. Good: I liked the 24/7 tea and coffee. I liked the front desk employees. I like that they try to help you out with anything you need.",2017
3.55,Bad: Ac wasnt working . Good: Clean,2017
4.8,Bad: WiFi was not working sometimes. Breakfast is pretty boring. Good: Nice location and hotel itself. The staff is nice and helpful.,2017
3.95,Bad: Pictures vs. Apperhence. Good: Price,2017
3.35,"Bad: In my opinion, the carpet needs to be replaced or cleaned urgently. It left an unpleasant musty smell in the room. I changed the room and the smell remained. After walking barefoot on the carpet and stepping into the tub, there were black dirt tracks in the tub. I expected the rooms to be as good as the standard of the lobby, the dining area and the pool area. Good: Excellent breakfast. The outside facilities, lobby and the pool area are very good.",2017
5.0,Bad: The meat at breakfast was horrible. Cheap no taste and the yogurt was horrible to I can tell it was real cheap brand . Good: The reception was so nice she let me check in early and the room was very clean. My kids love the pool.,2017
4.8,Good: reasonable choice of breakfast items.,2017
5.0,"Good: Location is great, 15 min away from Disneyland, Universal Studios, Airport. Breakfast was good, there is free parking and wifi as well as amazing small pool for refreshing. I would highly recommend this hotel, good value",2017
4.15,"Bad: One lonely and confused roach in the bathroom. Breakfast, but since we're Europeans this may be a matter of taste. Good: Spacious, comfortable rooms with air conditioning and dehumidifiers too. Nice reception area with a 24hrs possibility to buy toiletries, snacks, etc. Very close to the Disney parks and just next to a great Asian restaurant.",2017
5.0,Good: Love everything about my stay,2017
4.8,"Bad: There are not much things to do around apart from parks. If you look for a good restaurant, you may have to drive for 20 minutes or so. Good: Clean and comfortable room, friendly staff. It is close to Disney parks and about 20 drive to Universal parks and the airport. There is also free parks shuttle service provided.",2017
3.75,Bad: The breakfast was a little off. Good: We liked how convenient it is from Disney parks,2017
4.8,"Bad: The wifi on the third floor was very weak. I had to go to the lobby to use the wifi. Good: The folks at the front desk were very helpful, friendly, and professional. Overall, the location is great value. Just a 7 minute drive to Disney's Animal Kingdom. Excellent breakfast provided. Nice pool. Free parking. Free shuttle to parks. Lots of restaurants in the area. 30 minute drive from Orlando airport.",2017
1.25,Bad: Please take heed to this warning do not stay here. My car along with 3 other guest cars staying at this hotel were broken into overnight. The hotel didnt try to make us feel more safe or accommodate us.. They do not care at all. If you are trying to save money dont chance it by staying here unless you want your car broken into and you want your property stolen. It's not worth it you are better off staying in another hotel. This ruined our trip and we didn't feel safe staying there and management doesnt care at all also.. There is no security gaurds or cameras on this property so ask yourself if you want to be next. .,2017
5.0,Good: Breakfast was great!,2017
4.4,Bad: Nothing. Good: Very friendly personnel at the reception. Breakfast was good lots of choices. Beds had excellent matrasses. Ony 10 minute drive to Disney parks. Lots of restaurants nearby.,2017
2.5,"Bad: Room smelled, mattress was thin and hard. Clerk changed my rate to higher price when we arrived saying we got wrong rate. Charged more than was quoted on booking. Gave us a map and I guess they get a lot of complaints because it says FYI hotel built on 1989. Bring your own toiletries. Very little lighting in room and no electric plugs. Everything was plugged into an extension cord. Good: Location and parking.",2017
2.5,Bad: the value of the motel is not much with what you charged us.,2017
5.0,"Bad: There wasn't anything I didn't like. Good: All staff was very nice and extremely accommodating. The entire property was clean and well kept. The room was clean when we arrived and housekeeping came every morning to clean and verify all was well and if we needed any additional towels, toiletries etc. Their breakfast area was clean, the food was hot and fresh and there was plenty food to go around. I read some guests didn't like the breakfast voucher system but my husband and I liked them because we have stayed at other hotels where there is more people in the breakfast area than there is food. Their Wifi went down while at their business center, they informed me that the system was running slow and that their service provider was on property trying to fix it. I let them know that I was in the middle of a Disney ticket purchase and the front desk staff immediately got their own personal Hotspot set up on their front desk computer. They let me finish my Disney ticket purchase/transaction from their desk....yes from their desk... which i didn't expect. I was really happy cause that saved us alot of time and hassle. The hotel is close to WDW and plenty of dinning. It was overall a wonderful stay, nothing to complain about...other that they could accommodate me the extra day we decide to stay, but that was our fault since we did it last minute. Would HIGHLY recommend.",2017
4.8,"Bad: We loved everything, however they could have had longer breakfast times. Good: The bed was super comfy, the rooms were relatively soundproof - we could only hear when people walked by with large bags, the cleaning staff were great, 24/7 reception - very friendly, helpful. Pool was always clean and heated.",2017
4.15,Bad: The room was a bit smelly. Good: The location is perfect to get to Disneyworld. Rooms are large and confortable. Staff was usefull and nice. Excellent breakfast.,2017
4.6,"Bad: sound proof need it ... people on the second floor were running around and I couldn't sleep... Good: Rooms are renovated, location was perfect finally service and breakfast was great",2017
3.95,Bad: Old building- old room. Good: Staff- breakfast,2017
4.4,Bathroom disproportionately small compared to the rest of the room Hot breakfast of scrambled eggs and patties left a lot to be desired The theme park shuttle service was a disappointment only a handful of departures a day at not at all convenient times. We only took the shuttle once had to use Uber the rest of the time which was a pity cos I booked this hotel based on the free shuttle service to theme parks marketing Beds were huge and comfy Very friendly and helpful staff Location was good for access to Disney theme parks,2017
5.0,"Good: Staff, location, rooms and pool were alll first class. Shuttle bus was free to the parks and reliable. This hotel would be my first choice every time.",2017
5.0,Bad: Not enough supplies. Good: Everything,2017
4.8,"Bad: To be honest there wasn't anything I did not like which is rare specially with two kids. Good: I loved the room it was spacious and beautiful, with hardwood floors and all the necessities needed to be able to cook if you wanted, the rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable, I would definitely stay here again",2017
3.55,"Bad: The check in was not smooth at all. They gave us the wrong room key and number and the directions to the room were very hard to follow, took us 20 minutes and three trips to the front desk to find the room. Good: Pillows are great",2017
5.0,Bad: We had a ground unit and was unable to sleep until 11 pm every night because of the family above us had a kid that ran from 7 am to 11 pm for 3 nights. Suggestion: Put families with small kids on ground unit and that way we will all be comfort. Also requested early check in and wasnt assigned unit until 5 pm.,2017
4.15,"Bad: Rooms not ready when they said they were. Walls too thin and so it was noisy,. Could not get hot water in shower and the elevator broke. Also no corkscrew or cheese cutter which should be included. Good: The units were modern and well cared for. The price was good for the location. The layout of the unit was good. The staff was pleasant and I am sure would help if needed.",2017
5.0,"We stayed two nights here while in town to visit with our son that lives in the area. The hotel was excellent. Room was spacious, beds were comfortable and everything works correctly. Would definitely recommend.Hello Guest, Thank you so much for your kind review! We appreciate the recognition and are so happy you enjoyed your stay with us. It was a pleasure and we hope to see you again soon. Sincerely, Liz Lionberger General Manager",2017
5.0,"The hotel staff, Ms. Vundee (I think this is how you spell her name) was an excellent hostess/ waitress in the breakfast room, she made the experience worthwhile. She was the only one who was very welcoming, cheerful, informative, caring in general a very good leader (she deserves a raise). The others in the front desk were average. The full breakfast was good with many options!",2017
4.0,nice breakfast included some rooms are nice while others are bad/old or need repairs location near interstate highway.,2017
3.0,"We checked in very late to the hotel and asked if we could check out at 1 pm instead of noon and they said it was fine. I put the do not disturb sign on the door just to have the cleaning staff disregard it. They knocked twice at about 9:30 waking up my husband, and then proceeded to try opening the door. Since I had the lock on, they realized we were not ready for them to clean. They came back a second time an hour later and did the same thing. This time since my husband had woken up, I yelled out we're not ready! Do not disturb means do not disturb. I called the front desk and they said that they would talk to the cleaning manager. As we were getting ready, they knocked again and again. To say the least we ended up not sleeping well at all. This is unacceptable! What's the point of offering a sign that's going to be disregarded. I hope no one else has a similar experience.",2017
4.0,Appreciated the shuttle service! Very friendly staff.,2017
4.0,"The hotel was undergoing renovations and we did have a problem with the water leaking from the second floor on us as we were on the first floor. The kids loved the pool and the breakfast was very nice. They let you in the breakfast area all day which is very nice for late night snacks for the kids and drinks for the adults. The shuttle to the metro station to catch the subway into DC was very nice and they pick you up as well. I know some folks complain that the last pick up is at 9 pm, but since the DC mall exhibits close at 6 pm it was not a problem. Due to the price of the metro I would recommend the travel time to start on or after 9:30 am",2017
4.0,Thanks for daily breakfast. Great hospitality staff. Clean. Quiet. Easy access to restaurants and freeway.,2017
3.0,"This hotel is undergoing extensive renovation. It is currently filled with the sounds of hammering and the unrenovated sections are seriously outdated. We had a leaky air conditioner in the room which swamped the carpeting. I used four towels to mop up one section. The management was attentive to repairing the AC, but we had a fan running for two days to try to dry out the carpet. I'm sure this will be a great place once the renovations are complete.",2017
5.0,Complimentary breakfast is offered which is great when you're on a family trip. Located near the metro station and with many restaurants and stores in the surrounding area.,2017
3.0,"The towels were soft, pillows somewhat firm but there was a musty smell in the room. The breakfast was ok, eggs and bacon sub par. Its good vale for money and conveniently located.",2017
3.0,It has been a long time since I have had to give a security deposit. It hasn't been refunded yet either.,2017
4.0,"For being located in the city of D. C. the price was reasonable. My biggest complaint was that I booked ahead of time through Expedia and paid using my credit card. When I arrived I noticed that they gave AAA members a discount and asked if I can get the discount being that I am a member. Of course, they said sorry but you already paid for the room and there is nothing we can do about it. Gotta love it when computers tie the hands of people from being able to do what's right. I should have been able to receive this discount but, the computers would not allow it. This is wrong. In the past before modern technology they would have done this. While all this was happening there was a gentlemen next to me that complained about a price variance due to not receiving a AAA discount and the staff did an over-ride for him because he did not pay yet. I'm not sure I can use services such as Expedia again if this is the result. I hate feeling ripped off and I definitely was in this case so no more Expedia for me unless I get my discount back.",2017
5.0,"I was there to visit my daughter and her family, that live in Porstmouth, VA. The hotel is very close to them. I was able to bring my dog. The hotel staff allowed me to leave and leave my dog loose in the room, which was AWESOME! They even assured me that if he got loud, they would just call me. The room was a studio..plenty of room for us both. The hotel was refurbished a year ago. They offer breakfast each morning, waffles, fruit, cereal, etc. They even have snacks, drinks, for sale. Plus anything you might have forgotten! Love this place! I will go back regularly!",2017

5.0,"My boyfriend and I were celebrating our 5 year anniversary this past weekend. The hotel lobby was beautiful, clean and have a very welcoming vibe. The staff was extremely pleasant! Our room was clean, super cute and cozy. We had an adjoining room so we could hear the guest next door from time to time but it was not a bother what so ever. Overall our local get away was a much needed break from real life and this hotel provided the perfect space to relax, feel comfortable and enjoy the weekend.",2017
5.0,Everything was Wonderful until I saw that there was a Blood line on the side of the Tub... I told the Front Desk about it... Also We had to moved to another room because of Toilet Problems but I fount a Blood line at the other room.. I was contacted about it or Did anyone Higher the the Front Desk person Apologized to me and My family for anything.. Nor did I receive any type of discount.. I'm getting ready to stay there again...

4.0,"Great stay with a few minor discomforts The toilet stopped working and they sent up a maintenance worker with a plunger for us. we tried to plunge it but it didn't work. Went to the service desk the next morning but our request for help wasn't recorded and we had to submit another request. Maintenance worker came up and fixed the clog but before anyone fixed it my family had to go to the restroom near the lobby. On another note, Breakfast was great and kitchen staff was welcoming.",2017
3.0,"Overall our stay was decent. However, I would've rated it higher if the indoor pool was clean and usable. It was GREEN and smelled unkept which was disappointing with 2 children. In addition, the bathroom could've been cleaner. The toilet bowl was cleaned and the shower curtain was moldy. On a positive note, the staff was EXTREMELY friendly and the complimentary breakfast was quite yummy",2017
4.0,"Good location. Close to highway. Close to shopping and lots of nice restaurants on 58. Easy drive to zoo, Nauticus, USS Wisconsin, Botanical Gardens, Aquarium. Save money and purchase savings pass that gets you into 4 major attractions. About 60 mins to Williamsburg. Hotel is clean, free breakfast with good selections and changes every couple of days.",2017
2.0,Never make a mistake and leave anything behind. The housekeeping staff will claim to not have seen it. There is no point of having a lost and found and this hotel....very disappointing for a Hilton,2017
4.0,"I havw stayed at this hotel several times and the staff is pleasant and the rooms are clean. However, every time I stay there is usually a proble with the air conditioner or the heater. Each time maintenance has to fix it. I don't understand why the first nigjt I have to sleep sweating or cold because the air or heat is not working properly. I think the hotel must control the utilities from a central unit and they do not adjust the temperature for you until you complain. Otherwise, the hotel is lovely. Expect to pay a whopping 32 per night for parking. Unbelievable!",2017
5.0,Brilliant hotel and very helpful staff,2017

5.0,"This hotel has a lot to offer at a good value. The suite was spacious for the price. It offered a separate BR from the tv watching area and desk. It had two televisions, a fridge and microwave. The staff were courteous and friendly to a fault. This Embassy Suite was very close to the Monuments, literally an exit away. There were restaurants close, as well. As to the extras - the hotel offered on site parking in their private garage. There was a great complimentary breakfast each morning, offering every conceivable food. Last, there was a 3 hour happy hour that offered free drinks (adult beverages as well!) and snacks - daily! This Embassy Suite was very close to the Monuments, literally an exit away. There were restaurants close, as well. We would, absolutely, stay here again!",2017
5.0,"What one would expect for an RC property. The restaurant was excellent and the room was spacious and comfortable. It is near many restaurants and the Metro station is right in front for an affordable commute into D.C. All things considered, a great pick for you stay in the D.C. area.",2017

5.0,"Ever time we travel to D.C., one of our kids' favorite destinations, we struggle to find the right place in the right area. We either find a nice place that is almost a mile from the Metro stop or we find a crappy place within steps of a stop. The Ritz was on-point. From the ambience, to the staff, the quality of food, cleanliness of the rooms, down to the way they treated our children we loved it! The cherry on the ice cream is the Ritz is litterally 100 ft from the Metro. We will never search for a hotel again!",2017
5.0,"Staff was very friendly. Lifeguard went out of his way for us as did all of the staff. My kids loved the little gift shop. Food was good with egg burritos, pancakes, sausage and lots more.

4.0,"Amazing. Just 12 mins from the beach, donning, and other attractions. The breakfast was excellent!",2017
3.0,Not to cleanest or the dirtiest. Great breakfast buffet. Nice staff.,2017
2.0,The staff was great especially the valet. The room had no sound proof. Drunk people in the hall at midnight and we heard everything. We were on the 7th floor and everytime someone ran over a manhole cover we heard the noise clear as day. The worst was the tub though. You can tell they had a bath fitter installed but there was water between the old tub and the new liner so it felt as if we were showering on a water bed. Who knows what was growing in between the two surfaces. Also our one pillow had a big brown stain on it.,2017
3.0,For the most part we enjoyed our stay. We thought our room was much bigger as thats how it seemed advertised online and we also thought the lobby area would be bigger. We got stuck on the elevator had to pull the doors open ourselves to exit the elevator on the morning after our first nights stay. The staff was not very communicative about the elevator issues and did not really provide any real direction about updates /or ways to return to our rooms using another means other than the elevator.,2017
3.0,"Price was a little bit deceptive...when I booked the room, it stated that breakfast is included. However, it is not included in the quoted rate...you are charged an additional 9.95 per day (mandatory) for 2 bottles of water and the breakfast, plus use of the fitness center. Since this is mandatory, it should be included in the overall rate. The room was fine but there was a funny, fishy smell in the hallway on my floor. Not sure what that was all about.",2017
4.0,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here! It is mostly an average hotel, even a little run down in areas. BUT the incredible service (particularly from the Valet Parking staff) and close proximity to the Inner Harbor totally made up for all that. Highly recommend using their Valet service, the guys were very helpful and accommodating...they even let us keep our car there after we checked out and locked our luggage in the storage room at no extra charge! Not sure if this is part of their regular service, but we were sure happy with the arrangement! The beds were soft and super comfy, room was clean and relatively quiet from downtown noise, showers were hot with good pressure and breakfast the next day was decent. A solid choice for anyone on a budget wanting to be close to downtown!",2017

3.0,"It was a good hotel to spend for only one night there. The Wi-Fi didn't reach very well upstairs. Although, I overheard the staff indicate they were working on it. The hot water for the shower wasn't that hot or didn't have the potential to get that hot which could be good in a sense. I filled up an ice bucket and left it out overnight. The next morning, I discovered a dead cockroach. I don't know if that was a fluke, but that kind of shocked me a bit. I don't think bugs in general are very good. The area was quiet which was important to get some good sleep. The free breakfast was really good, the staff was super friendly, and the shuttle got me to the BWI airport fast. Overall, I think it's a good place, but needs a few things fixed. I recommend on the contingency those issues are fixed.",2017
2.0,"I called the Ramada the morning I was checking in to verify the check in time as well as verify that the room type I requested would be available, I was assured it would be. When I arrived a few hours later, the room type was unavailable. They also had a sign posted indicating the water would be off until 3:30pm. I should have received some sort of notification or gotten some sort of compensation for this considering the water was not back on until 5:45 or so. When I turned the faucet on the water was brown and disgusting - I certainly was not going to get ice or regular water from this establishment.Wi-Fi was incredibly spotty. No password, less than ZERO security. Disappointed.",2017

So ridiculous . She wasn't on a mood or something but very rude so if you can find another hotel go there ...",2017

3.0,"Stayed from Monday thru Friday and the last couple days were not very pleasant. Staff is very friendly and I always felt welcomed! Thursday house keeping was awful. I asked for clean bathroom towels everyday and they gave me dirty bathroom towels! They also gave me a dirty pillow case! Had to call the front desk two times. Was told I had to wait to get new clean bathroom towels and pillow cases because they were in the washer. This was at 5pm in the afternoon. Thankfully, Alex who works at the front desk was very nice and brought up new towels and pillow cases. He was also very apologetic. Friday my beds were not fixed and house keeping just dropped the towels off without doing anything in the hotel room.",2017

5.0,"Hotel is right off of the main highway into VA Beach, so it's very quick to get in and out. It is right by the boardwalk as well, within walking distance of the pier. So overall, I love the location! The room is small and divided into two section--living area (with pull out couch or another queen bed depending on room selection), and bedroom. I did not like the bedroom being by the hallway, the wall isn't thin but you can still hear people at night. The bathroom is nicely renovated recently, which was a big plus. Wife and kids loved the balcony facing the ocean, we enjoyed watching the beach at dusk. Overall, we had a very pleasant 3 nights stay at this Comfort Inn and will definitely book it for next year's trip back to VA Beach.",2017
2.0,"THE WORST BREAKFAST OF ANY HOTEL I'VE EVER STAYED AT. WE HAD TO GO OUT EVERY MORNING FOR BREAKFAST. ROOM HAD DOG FOOD PELLETS ON THE FLOOR. POOR CLEANING OF ROOM. THE VOLUME CONTROL OF THE TV DIDN'T WORK. THE HALL WAY TO OUR ROOM WAS EXTREMELY COLD. I WILL NEVER STAY AT AN EXTENDED STAY HOTEL EVER AGAIN. ALSO, NO POOL.",2017
4.0,"We only stayed one night, but we can see why it would be good for an extended stay. The room had a small kitchen and work area. We prefer to stay at hotels that offer a full breakfast, which this one didn't but that was okay, we just went to the Waffle House down the street. This is not a complaint by the way. We were mainly looking for a hotel close to Interstate 64 for one night and the lack of a full breakfast was not a big deal to us. The staff were friendly and courteous and the room was clean and adequate for our needs. We would stay here again if we are ever in the area.",2017

Diversidad de opciones de comida. El precio es una buena razon para esto. Es barato a pesar de la temporada.",2017

4.0,I enjoyed it. Breakfast is great although you did not have oatmeal that morning which I always love so that was not pleasant for me for breakfast. Please always have oatmeal.,2017
4.0,"The bathtub had scratches on it that shows black rust. The breakfast ends too early (9:00 a.m.), so if you are coming from a wedding party at 2:30 a.m. you can't sleep enough because you have to rush to have b-fast, and if you have kids you are for sure to miss it! Yet, rooms are spacious, TV is new, internet connection is good, and so is the location. Except from B-fast time and tub condition, I liked it.",2017

3.0,Hotel definitely needs updating. Worn carpet everywhere filthy evelator doors. Staff is rude not pleasant at all except nice ladies that work in the restaurant.

4.0,"Arrived at the Hotel from Dulles airport at 15:50 the young man on the reception who introduced himself as B was at once friendly and welcoming and made a good first impression. The hotel although a bit dated is clean and easy to get around, the room I was in was spacious and with the benefit of it's own kitchen a blessing after a long day sight seeing. A shuttle bus runs frequently to and from the hotel to Rosslyn Metro station and the driver helpful and friendly, although if the weather is nice a walk down the hill is to Rosslyn and the Metro is no more than 10 minutes. All in all a good hotel and location with easy access to Washington DC.",2017
4.0,"This was a business trip and I found the hotel occupied by business people as well as families. Staff was very friendly and accommodating, on all shifts. Bed was comfortable. My room was taken care of nicely except for one day when the bed was not made (I didn't mention it to the desk clerk). Breakfast was set up late every day (after 7 a.m. although the sign says 7:00 and I was told it is actually 6 to 6:30 and all the hot items required microwaving, so early birds can't really eat and run. It was impossible to control the heat, cool and humidity in the room but I understand a renovation is scheduled so I imagine that will correct that situation. Price was right. Overall, I would stay in this property again.",2017
1.0,"Arrived to find our room had a broken air-conditioner, the shower curtain rod was coming out of the drywall and the bathroom fan sounded like a jack hammer. the maintenance person could not fix the AC, there were no other rooms available, the windows did not open and it was like an over in the room. The staff did not offer to pay for us to room elsewhere etc due to the inconvenience. I would not recommend this facility. It was in disrepair. And as we were standing at the desk, a couple with 3 small children came in with a confirmation email and there reservation had been cancelled, so they had no room at all.",2017
